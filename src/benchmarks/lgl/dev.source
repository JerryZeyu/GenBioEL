William Lee Spafford III, 24, of Elkhart was indicted March 4 on the felony charge of evading arrest/detention with a vehicle, according to records released by the Anderson County district clerk\u2019s office. Shortly after 9 p.m. on Sept. 21, Anderson County sheriff\u2019s deputy Ronnie Howell attempted to make a stop on a 2001 Mercury Sabre for failure to yield the right of way, according to Anderson County Sheriff Greg Taylor. The vehicle\u2019s driver, later identified as Spafford, turned on to CR 2202 \u2014 also known as Salt Works Road \u2014 and stopped in the general vicinity of the Westwood Elementary School, according to the sheriff. As the deputy was approaching the car, Spafford accelerated from the scene, with Howell giving pursuit, according to Taylor. Spafford drove at \u201cunsafe speeds\u201d at times during the ensuing pursuit of approximately eight miles until slamming on his brakes on FM 645 in the Tennessee Colony area, causing the deputy\u2019s vehicle to strike the back of his Sabre, the sheriff stated. The suspect then exited his vehicle and fled on foot, but was subsequently apprehended by Howell following a short foot pursuit, according to Taylor. The sheriff said Spafford appeared \u201cdelusional\u201d following his arrest, saying the Mexican Mafia\u00c2 was \u201cafter him.\u201d \u00c2 Other indictments recently handed down by the grand jury included: Joyce Glover, 22, Palestine, date of alleged offense, Nov. 23, 2008.

["At Least 17 Slain in START Dagestani END Battle. MAKHACHKALA -- Three days of intense fighting between police and insurgents in a wooded area of Dagestan ended Saturday with five officers and about a dozen militants left dead, officials said. Clashes are frequent in Dagestan, but the fighting in an area near the border with Georgia and Azerbaijan was some of the most intense in recent months. Helicopter gunships fired on the militant positions. Regional Interior Ministry spokesman Mark Tolchinsky said 14 insurgents were killed, but Interfax cited the Federal Security Service as saying 12 died. \"The group committed several crimes in two regions in Dagestan,\" Dagestani Interior Minister Adilgirei Magomedtagirov told reporters. \"There are at least three non-Russians with Arab nationality among the dead militants, perhaps even four,\" he said. State-owned Vesti-24 television showed a row of dead rebels lying in the snow with Kalashnikov rifles slung across their limp shoulders. Magomedtagirov said a collection of Kalashnikov rifles, machine guns and a sniper rifle were found where the militants were hiding. Earlier, television showed helicopter gunships firing from the snowy skies at targets in a forest and armored vehicles rolling into the mountainous area. The police action, which began Wednesday, came after officials in the regions complained to regional authorities about the presence of the gunmen. Underscoring the seriousness of the fighting, state-run television prominently showed a meeting Friday between Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Dagestan's leader, Mukhu Aliyev. In the Dagestani capital, Makhachkala, police fatally shot four men Friday who failed to stop their car at a checkpoint and began shooting at officers, city police spokesman Shamil Guseinov said. The bodies of the four were shown on television lying among shattered glass near a battered, white Lada car. Dagestan's militants are seen as having been inspired by separatists in neighboring Chechnya. The fighting is the latest round of violence to plague the North Caucasus, pitting criminal gangs, Islamic militants or feuding clans against one another or against government and police forces. A three-hour shootout Thursday north of the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria left four gunmen killed. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck."]

["Risks pay off for START Saratoga END native who's film 'Haunting in Connecticut' is about to be released. Andrew Trapani is a gambling man. Rising from a West Valley College student to video game tester to Hollywood producer is a testament to Trapani's willingness to work hard and take risks. Those risks have paid off as Trapani's first major-release feature film, \"The Haunting in Connecticut,\" will open in theaters on March 27. But Trapani's story really begins about 20 years ago. Trapani rose quickly through the ranks in his five years with the company, going from game tester to designer and then ultimately to producer. The Saratoga native oversaw the development of some of the first Sony Playstation games, which was a transitioning period for video game developers as games went from cartridges to a CD format, which gave video games richer and more robust play, Trapani said. But one of the moments that steered the course of his career came in the late 1990s, when he produced a 30-minute movie-esque narrative for the video game, Solar Eclipse. Trapani and his crew spent three days shooting footage in Los Angeles. One day he and a peer were discussing what they would do if they won the lottery. Trapani said he would produce movies. After some thought, Trapani said he realized that he didn't have to win the lottery. So in March 1998 he resigned from his position and decided not long after to move to Los Angeles. \"I didn't have it all figured out, but I knew I wanted to do movies,\" he said. \"I always knew I wanted to do something that didn't require that I wear a suit every day.\" Within his first year in Los Angeles Trapani produced the independent film, \"True Rights,\" about a camera crew that chases down news events in hopes of locking up a movie deal. The movie was shot in 18 days on 35-millimeter film in what Trapani calls a \"run and gun, guerilla-style\" format. While in post-production on \"True Rights,\" Trapani received a call from someone he had worked with on the film, asking if he would be interested in producing commercials. Trapani said yes and spent a few months on commercial production. In 2000 Trapani founded Integrated Films, a production and management company, which has produced the movies Borderland, Tamara and the remake of Amityville Horror. But in a few days Trapani's latest film, \"The Haunting in Connecticut,\" will hit theaters across the nation, which will undoubtedly have much more exposure to a wider audience than any of his previous films. \"I'm really proud of it. I'm proud of everyone who contributed to it,\" he said. \"The Haunting\" is based on the true story of the Snedeker family, who moved into a Connecticut home back in the 1980s that had once been a mortuary. The story goes that the family was looking for an affordable place to live where their son, who was undergoing cancer treatment, could be closer to the hospital where he was receiving treatment. The family, not knowing the dark history of the home, began having unexplained things happen in their house. The movie stars Academy Award-nominated actress Virginia Madsen (\"Sideways\"). The idea to do this movie came to Trapani after he watched a 2003 documentary on the family on the Discovery Channel. He thought the story would make a great movie and contacted the family, eventually receiving the rights to make a feature film. Two years later Trapani was able to sell the movie to Gold Circle Films, an independent film production company, and the writers were able to begin putting together the script. \"At that point we were finally on our way to getting the movie made,\" Trapani said. The producer said that he knows that no matter how well this movie does, the mass audience will most likely never know who he is. And he says he is just fine with that. \"I didn't come to Los Angeles to be an actor,\" he said. \"Fame is not of interest to me.\" Instead, Trapani said he's much more interested in putting out quality films and having the respect of his peers. That's much more valuable to him, he says, and more in line with what he cares about. \"At the end of the day it's up to the producer to protect the integrity of the movie,\" he said. \"I just love movies. I understand them in a way that is a byproduct of what I was predisposed to do.\" Just as he's done with his career, Trapani said he follows his gut when it comes to making a movie.

["do if they won the lottery. Trapani said he would produce movies. After some thought, Trapani said he realized that he didn't have to win the lottery. So in March 1998 he resigned from his position and decided not long after to move to Los Angeles. \"I didn't have it all figured out, but I knew I wanted to do movies,\" he said. \"I always knew I wanted to do something that didn't require that I wear a suit every day.\" Within his first year in Los Angeles Trapani produced the independent film, \"True Rights,\" about a camera crew that chases down news events in hopes of locking up a movie deal. The movie was shot in 18 days on 35-millimeter film in what Trapani calls a \"run and gun, guerilla-style\" format. While in post-production on \"True Rights,\" Trapani received a call from someone he had worked with on the film, asking if he would be interested in producing commercials. Trapani said yes and spent a few months on commercial production. In 2000 Trapani founded Integrated Films, a production and management company, which has produced the movies Borderland, Tamara and the remake of Amityville Horror. But in a few days Trapani's latest film, \"The Haunting in Connecticut,\" will hit theaters across the nation, which will undoubtedly have much more exposure to a wider audience than any of his previous films. \"I'm really proud of it. I'm proud of everyone who contributed to it,\" he said. \"The Haunting\" is based on the true story of the Snedeker family, who moved into a Connecticut home back in the 1980s that had once been a mortuary. The story goes that the family was looking for an affordable place to live where their son, who was undergoing cancer treatment, could be closer to the hospital where he was receiving treatment. The family, not knowing the dark history of the home, began having unexplained things happen in their house. The movie stars Academy Award-nominated actress Virginia Madsen (\"Sideways\"). The idea to do this movie came to Trapani after he watched a 2003 documentary on the family on the Discovery Channel. He thought the story would make a great movie and contacted the family, eventually receiving the rights to make a feature film. Two years later Trapani was able to sell the movie to Gold Circle Films, an independent film production company, and the writers were able to begin putting together the script. \"At that point we were finally on our way to getting the movie made,\" Trapani said. The producer said that he knows that no matter how well this movie does, the mass audience will most likely never know who he is. And he says he is just fine with that. \"I didn't come to Los Angeles to be an actor,\" he said. \"Fame is not of interest to me.\" Instead, Trapani said he's much more interested in putting out quality films and having the respect of his peers. That's much more valuable to him, he says, and more in line with what he cares about. \"At the end of the day it's up to the producer to protect the integrity of the movie,\" he said. \"I just love movies. I understand them in a way that is a byproduct of what I was predisposed to do.\" Just as he's done with his career, Trapani said he follows his gut when it comes to making a movie. If it feels right, go for it; if not, something needs to change. He'll need his instincts to help him as he and his business partner, Brian Gilbert, move forward with other projects in their new production and management venture. Gilbert is the former production president of Stan Winston Studio, which was involved in such films as Jurassic Park, Alien and Iron Man, Trapani said. Trapani and Gilbert have already signed on for two Scooby Doo film sequels and a movie starring Nicholas Cage that will start filming early next year. The two are also involved in representing screenwriters and directors and helping them focus on their long-term career goals. Trapani admits that life can be a little overwhelming at times, especially since he can be working on 60 different projects at various stages of development. But he said he feeds off of it and is enthralled with film production. When things do get a little crazy on set, Trapani says that he thinks about Geoffrey Rush's character from \"Shakespeare in Love.\" Rush's character, Philip Henslowe, is asked how the play will be ready with so much madness going on around them. Rush replies, \"It's a mystery.\" He grew up in Saratoga, but it's Hollywood that Andy Trapani now calls home. Trapani is a movie producer, and his first major feature film,`The Haunting in START Connecticut END,' will hit the theaters on March 27."]

["Man recovers after 'killer bee' attack in Silverado Ranch area. A 53-year-old man remained hospitalized Sunday, a day after being stung \"a couple thousand times\" in what authorities are calling the worst bee attack around START Las Vegas END in 20 years. The man accidentally disturbed a nest of Africanized honey bees, also known as \"killer bees,\" when he overturned a boulder while operating a backhoe, Clark County Fire Department spokesman Scott Allison said Sunday. The incident happened in a Silverado Ranch neighborhood near Spencer Street and Eldorado Lane. He was listed in stable condition Sunday in the intensive care unit at St. Rose Dominican Hospital-Siena campus, hospital spokeswoman Kim Haley said. Haley said the man was stung a couple thousand times, and it was uncertain how long he would have to remain hospitalized. The man was stung on his face, arms, neck and back, Allison said, and firefighters sprayed bees off him with a hose. \"There were so many that they couldn't see the skin on his back when they got to him,\" he told The Associated Press. \"They said it was a black mass of bees on his back continuing to sting him. \"One of the vector control guys with the county said it was the biggest hive he had ever seen. He guessed it weighed about 50 pounds,\" he added. While not native to the U.S., killer bees are well established in southern Nevada. In 2000, a 77-year-old Las Vegas woman was stung about 500 times and survived. In 2003, a horse in Pahrump was killed after being attacked. \"I've been on the department for 20 years and don't remember an attack this bad,\" Allison said. \" (Responders) told me it was like something out of a horror movie.\" Experts urge people under attack to run as fast as possible, saying it's possible to outrun bees if one can run fast and far enough. They also urge people not to jump in swimming pools, saying bees can see people and wait for them there."]

["START Mansfield END council to vote today on $765,000 financing package. MANSFIELD \u2014 The Law Enforcement Center will get some parking relief and other improvements and repairs if the City Council approves a $765,000 financing package today.

Among the remaining projects is expanding parking at the center to keep up with the growing number of staff members. \"We\u2019ve been out of parking for years,\" Patrol Commander Kyle Lanier said. The council meeting is at 7 p.m. at City Hall, 1200 E. Broad St. Lanier said the renovations, which could begin by mid-April, would also include electrical work, fencing, gates, painting and landscaping. None of the scheduled improvements are for the patrol division, where officers are finishing their own volunteer remodeling effort. They have replaced drywall, repainted, installed cabinets and overhauled bathrooms, saving $50,000 to $100,000, they say. In other action, the council will consider authorizing staff to take advantage of lower interest rates and refinance about $10.3 million of city debt.

["Meteor or piece of spacecraft caused fireball, boom, expert says. A fireball and big boom that people witnessed Sunday night could have been caused by a meteor or even a falling part from a START Russian END spacecraft, experts say. \"I know it's one of the two,\" said Geoff Chester, an astronomer and public relations officer with the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington. \"I just can't tell you definitively which one it actually was.\" People in parts of Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina reported a light similar to fireworks about 9:40 p.m., followed by an explosive sound. Chester suggested that a falling Russian booster rocket caused the hubbub. The booster -- a steel cylinder about 25 feet long and 8 feet wide -- was part of the Soyuz spacecraft that launched Thursday on a mission to the International Space Station. The booster was expected to fall toward Earth on a path, headed east, that would have taken it across the Chesapeake Bay region Sunday night, Chester said. The booster would have burned in the friction of the Earth's atmosphere and, as it slowed below the speed of sound, it would have released energy that caused a sonic boom, Chester said. \"My feeling is this is what people actually saw,\" Chester said. Stefan Bocchino, a spokesman for the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, said experts there do not think the light was caused by a manmade object. The Joint Space Operations Center tracks manmade objects that enter the atmosphere. The National Weather Service has ruled out any weather-related cause. Other experts said the light and boom sound like the work of a meteor. Meteors are bits of space rock or gravel that burn and create light when they hit the atmosphere. \"Some very bright ones are known to explode,\" creating a sound, said Phillip Ianna, a professor emeritus of astronomy at the University of Virginia. Meteors typically burn up in the atmosphere. Much less often, a small piece of the rock will hit Earth. Steve Chesley, an astronomer with NASA, said the Sunday phenomenon could be the work of a meteor the size of a television set or small car. \"These kinds of things hit the [atmosphere] once a month,\" Chesley said. They usually fall over water or less-populated areas and attract less attention. NASA doesn't track such small objects, Chesley said, and focuses instead on big ones -- space rocks half the length of a football field or more -- that are headed toward Earth. \"It's the big ones we're worried about, and we need to find them decades in advance,\" Chesley said. The object on Sunday had to be unusually bright to be seen in urban areas, where artificial lights drown out most celestial objects, said David Hagan, a staff scientist with the Science Museum of Virginia. \"It had to be quite a phenomenon to be observed from Shockoe Bottom,\" Hagan said. Brian Munford, 43, of Richmond, was driving in Short Pump when he saw the light. \"It was like a Roman candle headed the wrong way, coming down.... It was pretty cool-looking.\" Chester, of the Naval Observatory, said objects burning in the sky can appear deceptively close when they actually are many miles away."]

Stefan Bocchino, a spokesman for the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, said experts there do not think the light was caused by a manmade object. The Joint Space Operations Center tracks manmade objects that enter the atmosphere. The National Weather Service has ruled out any weather-related cause. Other experts said the light and boom sound like the work of a meteor. Meteors are bits of space rock or gravel that burn and create light when they hit the atmosphere. \"Some very bright ones are known to explode,\" creating a sound, said Phillip Ianna, a professor emeritus of astronomy at the University of Virginia. Meteors typically burn up in the atmosphere. Much less often, a small piece of the rock will hit Earth. Steve Chesley, an astronomer with NASA, said the Sunday phenomenon could be the work of a meteor the size of a television set or small car. \"These kinds of things hit the [atmosphere] once a month,\" Chesley said. They usually fall over water or less-populated areas and attract less attention. NASA doesn't track such small objects, Chesley said, and focuses instead on big ones -- space rocks half the length of a football field or more -- that are headed toward Earth. \"It's the big ones we're worried about, and we need to find them decades in advance,\" Chesley said. The object on Sunday had to be unusually bright to be seen in urban areas, where artificial lights drown out most celestial objects, said David Hagan, a staff scientist with the Science Museum of Virginia. \"It had to be quite a phenomenon to be observed from Shockoe Bottom,\" Hagan said. Brian Munford, 43, of Richmond, was driving in Short Pump when he saw the light. \"It was like a Roman candle headed the wrong way, coming down....

["Meteor or piece of spacecraft caused fireball, boom, expert says.

["Head of controversial START Palestinian END orchestra banned from West Bank camp. The head of a Palestinian youth orchestra who set off an uproar by performing a concert for Holocaust survivors in Israel was blocked Tuesday from entering a West Bank refugee camp because of concerns for her safety, a local official said. Security official Radi Asiba said the life of the orchestra conductor, Wafa Younis, would have been at risk if she remained in the area of the Jenin refugee camp. Younis, an Arab woman from Israel, led a small orchestra for Palestinian youths in the hardscrabble camp. But she fell out of favor with residents after taking the orchestra to play for the Holocaust survivors last week. \"When Younis tried to enter the camp on Tuesday, she was halted by a prominent local leader,\" Asiba said. \"We informed her that she is forbidden from entering Jenin because her presence causes tensions,\" he said. Younis struck a sensitive nerve. Many Palestinians are reluctant to acknowledge Jewish historical suffering because of concerns that it weakens their own claims to victimhood and to the land. Ignorance and even denial of the Nazi genocide during World War II are common in Palestinian society. Parents said they were not told their children would perform for the Holocaust survivors. Residents of the Jenin camp are descendants of the some 700,000 Palestinians who either fled or were expelled from their homes in the war that followed Israel's creation, an event Arabs call the Naqba, or catastrophe. They said they were angry with Younis because their children had performed for Holocaust survivors while Israel had not acknowledged the suffering caused to them.

["Head of controversial Palestinian orchestra banned from START West Bank END camp. The head of a Palestinian youth orchestra who set off an uproar by performing a concert for Holocaust survivors in Israel was blocked Tuesday from entering a West Bank refugee camp because of concerns for her safety, a local official said. Security official Radi Asiba said the life of the orchestra conductor, Wafa Younis, would have been at risk if she remained in the area of the Jenin refugee camp. Younis, an Arab woman from Israel, led a small orchestra for Palestinian youths in the hardscrabble camp. But she fell out of favor with residents after taking the orchestra to play for the Holocaust survivors last week. \"When Younis tried to enter the camp on Tuesday, she was halted by a prominent local leader,\" Asiba said. \"We informed her that she is forbidden from entering Jenin because her presence causes tensions,\" he said. Younis struck a sensitive nerve. Many Palestinians are reluctant to acknowledge Jewish historical suffering because of concerns that it weakens their own claims to victimhood and to the land. Ignorance and even denial of the Nazi genocide during World War II are common in Palestinian society. Parents said they were not told their children would perform for the Holocaust survivors. Residents of the Jenin camp are descendants of the some 700,000 Palestinians who either fled or were expelled from their homes in the war that followed Israel's creation, an event Arabs call the Naqba, or catastrophe.

["START U.S. END to spend $1m on accommodations for Mideast envoy George Mitchell. U.S. officials said Friday the State Department will spend about $1 million to renovate, reconfigure and furnish the Washington workspace of special Mideast peace envoy George Mitchell and outfit satellite offices for him in Jerusalem and in New York, where he lives. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said Friday that $27,000 has already been set aside to upgrade Mitchell's sixth-floor suite at the department's headquarters and that more money may be needed. Additional funding may be required for further work as staffing requirements and other needs are identified, Wood said. This reconfiguration and renovation is designed to enhance efficiencies and staff coordination for this very important mission. The cost of the other offices is still being determined, but officials say they expect the price for all three, excluding additional staff, to reach seven figures. Mitchell and his staff had been allocated rooms on the State Department's first floor near the offices of other special envoys such as Richard Holbrooke, Dennis Ross and Todd Stern, who handle, respectively, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Southwest Asia and the Gulf, and climate change. But officials said he wanted to be closer to the front office of the department's Near East regional bureau, which is located on the sixth floor and that the renovations were needed to adapt the available space there. Mitchell, the former Senate Democratic leader who negotiated the Northern Ireland peace accord, does not receive a government salary."]

["Cancer drugs prompt START Bicester END teenager's slim. A TEENAGER who is fighting leukaemia has joined a slimming club after being told by doctors to lose weight. Matthew Holder-Wooloff, 15, from Bicester, was introduced to Slimming World classes by his mother just over a year ago, after his treatment for leukaemia caused him to pile on over two stone. The steroids that doctors prescribed for Matthew, a student at The Cooper School in Bicester, after he was diagnosed with the blood and bone marrow cancer also reduced his bone density, so the young rugby fan found he was too weak to play his favourite sport. Matthew\u2019s mother, Jackie, said: \u201cMatthew was diagnosed in 2007. We thought he had come down with a really bad cold and cough and couldn\u2019t seem to shake it off, so we took him to the doctors. \u201cAs part of the treatment he was given steroids and one of the side effects is a huge appetite.\u201d Matthew, who is 5ft 8ins tall, saw his weight jump from about 12 stone to 14 stone. Mrs Holder-Wooloff said: \u201cI decided to take Matthew to Slimming World because I\u2019d seen how well it worked for other members of my family. \u201cWe ran it past the hospital and they were very happy with the idea. \u201cMy sister\u2019s family lost about 17 stone between four of them there, so we knew it worked. \u201cWhen he was in hospital I found I gained a lot of weight too because I was spending all of my time with him and living on food from the cafe, so I went with him.\u201d In the year Mrs Holder-Wooloff and her son have been members, she has lost two stone and Matthew has shed a stone and half. According to Slimming World, its members lose weight through a combination of a healthy diet, moderate exercise, and group support sessions where members are encouraged to shun bad eating habits. The sessions cost \u00a34.50 a week, but children between 11 and 15 can join for free if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. Although it will be another 14 months before Matthew can be given the all-clear from the disease, he and his mother intend to carry on with the weekly sessions at Southwold School, in Holm Way, Bicester. Matthew said: \u201cIt has absolutely been such a big change for me, but I am much happier with what I\u2019m eating. \u201cI\u2019ve had more steroid treatment recently, which caused me to put a bit of the weight back on, but now I know what to do to lose it again.\u201d Mrs Holder-Wooloff added: \u201cIt\u2019s still difficult for him because he can\u2019t do his sports, and even swimming is off because of the tubes that go into his body. But he has definitely slimmed down and is happier.\u201d * Oxford GP Dr Tia MacGregor, who is based at St Bartholomew's Surgery in Manzil Way, East Oxford, backed the idea as a good way to combat the effect steroids have on a patient\u2019s metabolism. She added: \u201cI would be wary of some of the \u2018faddier\u2019 diets that suggest dropping calorie intake to something ridiculous like 400 a day, but recognised classes such as these are perfectly fine.\u201d"]

Matthew Holder-Wooloff, 15, from Bicester, was introduced to Slimming World classes by his mother just over a year ago, after his treatment for leukaemia caused him to pile on over two stone. The steroids that doctors prescribed for Matthew, a student at The Cooper School in Bicester, after he was diagnosed with the blood and bone marrow cancer also reduced his bone density, so the young rugby fan found he was too weak to play his favourite sport. Matthew\u2019s mother, Jackie, said: \u201cMatthew was diagnosed in 2007. We thought he had come down with a really bad cold and cough and couldn\u2019t seem to shake it off, so we took him to the doctors. \u201cAs part of the treatment he was given steroids and one of the side effects is a huge appetite.\u201d Matthew, who is 5ft 8ins tall, saw his weight jump from about 12 stone to 14 stone. Mrs Holder-Wooloff said: \u201cI decided to take Matthew to Slimming World because I\u2019d seen how well it worked for other members of my family. \u201cWe ran it past the hospital and they were very happy with the idea. \u201cMy sister\u2019s family lost about 17 stone between four of them there, so we knew it worked. \u201cWhen he was in hospital I found I gained a lot of weight too because I was spending all of my time with him and living on food from the cafe, so I went with him.\u201d In the year Mrs Holder-Wooloff and her son have been members, she has lost two stone and Matthew has shed a stone and half. According to Slimming World, its members lose weight through a combination of a healthy diet, moderate exercise, and group support sessions where members are encouraged to shun bad eating habits. The sessions cost \u00a34.50 a week, but children between 11 and 15 can join for free if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. Although it will be another 14 months before Matthew can be given the all-clear from the disease, he and his mother intend to carry on with the weekly sessions at Southwold School, in Holm Way, Bicester. Matthew said: \u201cIt has absolutely been such a big change for me, but I am much happier with what I\u2019m eating. \u201cI\u2019ve had more steroid treatment recently, which caused me to put a bit of the weight back on, but now I know what to do to lose it again.\u201d Mrs Holder-Wooloff added: \u201cIt\u2019s still difficult for him because he can\u2019t do his sports, and even swimming is off because of the tubes that go into his body. But he has definitely slimmed down and is happier.\u201d * Oxford GP Dr Tia MacGregor, who is based at St Bartholomew's Surgery in Manzil Way, East START Oxford END, backed the idea as a good way to combat the effect steroids have on a patient\u2019s metabolism. She added: \u201cI would be wary of some of the \u2018faddier\u2019 diets that suggest dropping calorie intake to something ridiculous like 400 a day, but recognised classes such as these are perfectly fine.\u201d"]
["Hit-and-run defendant makes court appearance. A young woman accused of driving the vehicle that killed Terry A. Corbin in a hit-and-run accident made her first court appearance Thursday morning. Ashley L. Evans, 26, of START Paris END, was in the custody of the Edgar County Sheriff\u2019s Department for an appearance before Judge David W. Lewis. The purpose of the hearing was to advise Evans of the charge against her, explain her trial rights as a U.S. citizen and to address the issue of legal counsel. Evans is charged with a single Class 1 felony of leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident that resulted in death and failing to report the accident to law enforcement. Lewis advised Evans that a penitentiary sentence of between four and 15 years is possible upon conviction. Probation is another sentencing option. While awaiting her turn before the bench, Evans often sat with her face in her hands. She spoke softly during the hearing and said little except to answer questions from the court, although she did say she will try to hire defense counsel. She was remanded back to custody on a $50,000 bond. Also appearing was Guy C. Harminson, 26, of Paris. Harminson is charged with a Class 4 felony of obstruction of justice, alleging he provided investigators with false information about the accident in order to prevent Evans\u2019 arrest. Evans and Harminson share a rural Paris address. Harminson said he cannot afford legal counsel and public defender L. Kaye DeSelms was assigned to the case. He was remanded to custody on a $15,000 bond. Corbin died Dec. 6, 2008, at Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana, approximately nine-hours after Paris emergency personnel found him lying in the southbound lane of state Route 1 at the Marshall Street cutoff."]

["START Ohio END recession: Pay cuts, fewer police. MOUNT GILEAD (AP) -- A city court won't accept new cases because it's out of paper and has no money to reorder. Elsewhere, more firefighters are accepting wage decreases to save their jobs, and administrators at another state university are freezing their pay. Public entities around Ohio are hoping gestures like these will protect them from bigger problems caused by the recession. The gestures come when there's no relief in sight for battered Ohio, whose unemployment rate has hit 8.8 percent, a two-decade high. Tax revenue is flat at best or plunging at worst as layoffs continue and residents sew up their wallets and pocketbooks. In Mount Gilead, Judge Lee McClelland, of Morrow County Municipal Court in north-central Ohio, says the court has just enough paper to handle hearing notices and other documents for pending cases. He says several county agencies have volunteered to bring their own paper in to handle their filings. The court also is switching to a four-day work week to save money. In Euclid, in the northeast, firefighters agreed to a 2-percent pay cut and less money for continuing education and retirement funds for new firefighters in exchange for no layoffs. The city already has laid off 17 jail employees and is hoping to avoid police department layoffs. In Youngstown, Mayor Jay Williams wants city employees to work four fewer hours a week, equivalent to a 10 percent pay cut, to avoid layoffs. He's also taking a 10 percent cut, or about $10,500 in wages and benefits. Youngstown State University President David Sweet, who makes about $230,000 a year, said Friday he and eight top university officials will give up their 3 percent pay raises to create a new student financial aid fund. Earlier this month, Ohio State University said it would freeze the pay of President Gordon Gee and 18 members of his management team and put the money toward student scholarships. Top administrators at Wright State University will give up raises this year and contribute to an emergency relief fund for students. In Mansfield, Richland County Sheriff Steve Sheldon is scheduled to lay off 11 employees, though grant money saved an extra three jobs that were to be cut. The police union is proposing alternatives to layoffs, including eliminating part-time or seasonal jobs first. In Columbus, city firefighters agreed to a pay freeze to avoid layoffs. Police declined the offer and were about to lose 25 newly hired recruits when Mayor Michael Coleman announced $1.25 million in federal stimulus money would save their jobs for now. But small gestures won't work in every cash-strapped city. Toledo Mayor Carty Finkbeiner says he plans in May to lay off 75 police officers, about 12 percent of the division, if the city doesn't receive $35 million in federal stimulus funds."]

["Ohio recession: Pay cuts, fewer police. MOUNT GILEAD (AP) -- A city court won't accept new cases because it's out of paper and has no money to reorder. Elsewhere, more firefighters are accepting wage decreases to save their jobs, and administrators at another state university are freezing their pay. Public entities around START Ohio END are hoping gestures like these will protect them from bigger problems caused by the recession. The gestures come when there's no relief in sight for battered Ohio, whose unemployment rate has hit 8.8 percent, a two-decade high. Tax revenue is flat at best or plunging at worst as layoffs continue and residents sew up their wallets and pocketbooks. In Mount Gilead, Judge Lee McClelland, of Morrow County Municipal Court in north-central Ohio, says the court has just enough paper to handle hearing notices and other documents for pending cases. He says several county agencies have volunteered to bring their own paper in to handle their filings. The court also is switching to a four-day work week to save money. In Euclid, in the northeast, firefighters agreed to a 2-percent pay cut and less money for continuing education and retirement funds for new firefighters in exchange for no layoffs. The city already has laid off 17 jail employees and is hoping to avoid police department layoffs. In Youngstown, Mayor Jay Williams wants city employees to work four fewer hours a week, equivalent to a 10 percent pay cut, to avoid layoffs. He's also taking a 10 percent cut, or about $10,500 in wages and benefits. Youngstown State University President David Sweet, who makes about $230,000 a year, said Friday he and eight top university officials will give up their 3 percent pay raises to create a new student financial aid fund. Earlier this month, Ohio State University said it would freeze the pay of President Gordon Gee and 18 members of his management team and put the money toward student scholarships. Top administrators at Wright State University will give up raises this year and contribute to an emergency relief fund for students.

Police declined the offer and were about to lose 25 newly hired recruits when Mayor Michael Coleman announced $1.25 million in federal stimulus money would save their jobs for now. But small gestures won't work in every cash-strapped city. START Toledo END Mayor Carty Finkbeiner says he plans in May to lay off 75 police officers, about 12 percent of the division, if the city doesn't receive $35 million in federal stimulus funds."]

["City adjusts budget for recycling, winter maintenance. START TORRINGTON END \u2014 City Council tentatively approved several budget changes during a meeting Wednesday, that would affect recycling and winter maintenance supplies for the 2009-10 fiscal year. Mayor Ryan Bingham proposed a reduction of $150,000 in a disposal line item, putting the funds at $1 million. Jerry Rollett, city engineer, noted that was the cost of savings from the city\u2019s decision to switch to single-stream recycling. Last week the council unanimously approved the switch to the new system, which would allow residents to combine recyclables in the same bin. The vote came with an approval to utilize USA Hauling and Recycling Inc.Along with accepting the new company, the refuse contract line item jumped from $893,000 to $1.77 million. The reason for the hike was due to the contract with USA Hauling, which was numbered at $2.06 million for the year. A combination of other line items made up for the remainder of the contract prices, he said."]

["'Free' Money Headed to START Alexandria END. It\u2019s not as simple a concept as the traditional Santa Claus delivering presents to a struggling family at Christmas, but the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the federal stimulus package, has City Hall creating a wish list for the money\u2019s allocation. And the complexity of the funding has the city checking that list over and over and over again. The proposed list, comprised of needs from city departments, once consisted of hundreds of projects worth over $600 million on which the city hoped to capitalize. Officials did not expect to receive that vast amount of funding, but dubbed it part of their vetting process to allocate the money. Since President Barack Obama signed the Act, that list has been narrowed down to about 25 to 30 projects, according to Mayor Bill Euille. But receiving stimulus money and implementing it in the city\u2019s best interest seems to be consumed by the dense bureaucracy of federal lawmaking and the fluid nature of the stimulus package itself. Some money will also go through the state to be allocated by Governor Tim Kaine. \u201cEverything is changing on the dime, hour by hour, day by day,\u201d Euille said, a day after spending four hours on the Hill with other mayors and Congressional delegations. Officials would not prioritize the various projects they hope to achieve, but have set up an intergovernmental system to monitor the myriad stipulations and rules crowding around the free money. Essentially, it is a task force that will make sure projects fundable by the Act won\u2019t fall through the cracks while making sure projects that qualify meet the necessary criteria. The City Council will have ultimate say, according to a memo that places the body at the top of the chain, and although the city has its own priorities, they do not always parallel the funding available from the stimulus package. The city will have to prioritize according to other factors as well, like speed. \u201cExpediency will be important, and those projects that are \u2018shovel ready\u2019 will be more likely to receive federal funding,\u201d stated City Manager Jim Hartmann in a memo to the mayor and City Council that reflected a briefing from Congressman Jim Moran (D \u2013 8). \u201cCertainly we have some potential to do things that were not otherwise on the priority list but are important long-range projects,\u201d City Manager Jim Hartmann said. \u201cMuch of the energy efficiency items \u2014they have a long term payback for the city. So frankly we welcome those things.\u201d The most recent published wish list (which consists of much more than 30 projects), contains everything from restructuring the city marina to repaving Interstate 395 to helping victims of the recession. Among 12 other committees in the workflow, the implementation committee has the job of obtaining the actual grant funding for such projects as well as clearing any hurdles to obtaining funding. \u201cThe implementation committee is going to look for, primarily, barriers to implementation,\u201d Hartmann said. \u201cIf we have a priority project [we will] move it as fast as we can while being mindful of the rules and regulations that we have in the city.\u201d Money from the stimulus package was not accounted for in the city\u2019s current proposed budget, so some of the money could supplant or offset budget gaps, even if the city cannot use them as part of the budget, perhaps having to utilize itemized grants based on the stimulus plan\u2019s stipulations. \u201cThe devil\u2019s going to be in the details,\u201d Hartmann said. \u201cWhether certain stimulus spending might be seen as supplanting the budget depends on if it\u2019s allowed or not. If there are things in the budget where we could use stimulus funds instead of using city funds that could be used for other critical areas, certainly those will be considered. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to calculate what that net benefit may be. I think there will be a smaller portion of offsetting things within the budget, but it will be able to help us accomplish other goals that maybe were not funded in this budget.\u201d Citing the fluid nature of the process and the numerous departments in line and in need for funding, officials would not prioritize one project over another. But Hartmann gave the \u201cclassic\u201d example of Polk School Gymnasium, a \u201cshovel ready\u201d project that has already been designed and is awaiting funding to be realized. Still, it is not yet certain if the project has a money pot available. \u201cI don\u2019t have the authority to say this project is going to go ahead of that project,\u201d Euille said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a total collaboration because we have every department and agency involved.\u201d There is no distinct timeline on when final decisions will occur; it will take more"]

["Senate DFL proposes cuts, $2 billion tax hike. However, the DFL plan does not include $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money that lawmakers still do not know just how they can use. The Thursday announcement brought the first public acknowledgment that Democrats would increase taxes to help balance the budget. Senate Tax Chairman Tom Bakk, DFL- START Cook END, said a \"lion's share\" of the $2 billion in new revenue would come from higher taxes on the rich, apparently via the income tax. The plan calls for cutting every segment of state government, for a total of $2.4 billion. While the Democratic leaders say they would take roughly equal amounts of new taxes and program cuts to balance the budget, they have yet to figure out where to put about $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money. Given that, Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, said education cuts may end up being moderated once details of how the state can spend the federal money are unraveled. The state's $33 billion two-year budget would be $6.4 billion short without cuts, new taxes and federal money. Pawlenty figures the federal money into his budget and calls the deficit $4.6 billion. He is to announce changes to his budget in the next week to 10 days, taking into account recent economic changes. Pawlenty's spokesman said it was good that DFL leaders \"are finally publicly admitting they'd like to wallop the families and small businesses of Minnesota with massive tax increases.\" Brian McClung added that the cuts did not look at funding priorities. \"An off-the-shelf computer program could do these kinds of across-the-board cuts,\" McClung said. \"We would expect more from DFL legislators.\" Tom Dooher, president of Education Minnesota, was not happy with the Senate announcement. \"The proposed cuts are not in the best interest of Minnesota\u00e2 s school children,\" Dooher said. \"If enacted, they would seriously harm the quality of education the state takes pride in providing its students.\" House leaders plan to announce their budget outline soon, too. House and Senate committees will work out details of their budgets, then establish conference committees to work out differences between the two budgets. Pawlenty often has said he will veto tax increases, and Pogemiller has said that he believes Pawlenty. A third of the budget balancing act Democrats propose relies on higher taxes. Bakk said he would not allow his committee to consider adding the sales tax to clothing or services. Other taxes may be considered, he said, although higher taxes on the rich are his primary goal. Bakk also said he would like to freeze the amount of money the state gives local governments at a time when most policymakers are calling for a cut in local government aid. Pawlenty would cut the aid, which has raised city leaders' ire. Local governments will be forced to enact moderate property tax increases to deal with the DFL budget, Bakk said, but less than under Pawlenty's proposal. Republican senators said they were not consulted about the proposal. They called tax increases job killers, supporting Pawlenty's proposed business tax cuts instead. Pogemiller said drastic measures such as the 7 percent cut are needed because of the current recession. Most of the cuts, he added, will be to programs most affecting the state's needy residents. He called the economy \"as bad, potentially, as the 1930s.\" The Minnesota House unanimously voted to support freedom of the press Thursday, after a week of controversy. House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall \u00e2 \u201c joined by House Majority Leader Tony Sertich, DFL-Chisholm \u00e2 \u201c brought a motion to the floor voicing that support because proposed House rules would have restricted media work on the House floor and in committees. The proposed rules emerged a week ago today, creating a stir among the Capitol press corps. Then, Monday night, a committee page demanded to see credentials from a photographer \u00e2 \u201c two hours after a House leadership spokesman assured the media that no credentials would be needed to cover committee meetings. Seifert said recent events had \"a chilling effect\" on the press. \"I am very concerned about what has taken place recently.\" Sertich said the proposed rules will not be implemented. He said there has been confusion as the rules were being discussed and no changes should have been made by House staff members. Rep. Torrey Westrom, R-Elbow Lake, said the talk of stricter press rules is a sign of bigger problems with DFL leaders. \"I know the press isn't really happy with some of the moves going on around here,\" Westrom said. \"I'm glad they are speaking up.\" Numerous House members have told reporters that they also were not happy with the proposals."]

["Senate DFL proposes cuts, $2 billion tax hike. However, the DFL plan does not include $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money that lawmakers still do not know just how they can use. The Thursday announcement brought the first public acknowledgment that Democrats would increase taxes to help balance the budget. Senate Tax Chairman Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said a \"lion's share\" of the $2 billion in new revenue would come from higher taxes on the rich, apparently via the income tax. The plan calls for cutting every segment of state government, for a total of $2.4 billion. While the Democratic leaders say they would take roughly equal amounts of new taxes and program cuts to balance the budget, they have yet to figure out where to put about $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money. Given that, Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, said education cuts may end up being moderated once details of how the state can spend the federal money are unraveled. The state's $33 billion two-year budget would be $6.4 billion short without cuts, new taxes and federal money. Pawlenty figures the federal money into his budget and calls the deficit $4.6 billion. He is to announce changes to his budget in the next week to 10 days, taking into account recent economic changes. Pawlenty's spokesman said it was good that DFL leaders \"are finally publicly admitting they'd like to wallop the families and small businesses of Minnesota with massive tax increases.\" Brian McClung added that the cuts did not look at funding priorities. \"An off-the-shelf computer program could do these kinds of across-the-board cuts,\" McClung said. \"We would expect more from DFL legislators.\" Tom Dooher, president of Education Minnesota, was not happy with the Senate announcement. \"The proposed cuts are not in the best interest of Minnesota\u00e2 s school children,\" Dooher said. \"If enacted, they would seriously harm the quality of education the state takes pride in providing its students.\" House leaders plan to announce their budget outline soon, too. House and Senate committees will work out details of their budgets, then establish conference committees to work out differences between the two budgets. Pawlenty often has said he will veto tax increases, and Pogemiller has said that he believes Pawlenty. A third of the budget balancing act Democrats propose relies on higher taxes. Bakk said he would not allow his committee to consider adding the sales tax to clothing or services. Other taxes may be considered, he said, although higher taxes on the rich are his primary goal. Bakk also said he would like to freeze the amount of money the state gives local governments at a time when most policymakers are calling for a cut in local government aid. Pawlenty would cut the aid, which has raised city leaders' ire. Local governments will be forced to enact moderate property tax increases to deal with the DFL budget, Bakk said, but less than under Pawlenty's proposal.

Several members of these groups were arrested this morning. The Interior Ministry was not planning to make any statement until the end of the investigation, but some political and public organizations have responded to the incident and the issue was seriously politicized. The representatives of some political parties made tough statements. Hence, the Interior Ministry is providing to the society a part of evidence proving criminal activities of the detainees. Other evidences and information will be unveiled later.\u201d The evidence involves six separate episodes of covertly recorded footage of what seems to be a sting operation by undercover agents acting as arms dealers. In the fist footage a man identified as Giorgi Bolashvili, an activist from DMUG youth wing, negotiates with undercover agent terms for purchase of CZ-75 semi-automatic pistol for USD 400 and expresses desire to buy AKS-U submachine gun \u2013 a shortened version of Kalashnikov assault rifle.

Ten persons, most of them affiliated with former parliamentary speaker Nino Burjanadze\u2019s party, have been arrested on charges of illegal purchase of firearms, the Georgian Interior Ministry said on March 23. Earlier on the same day Democratic Movement\u2013United Georgia (DMUG) party said nine of its activists were arrested in Batumi and START Tbilisi END, accusing the authorities of launching \u201ccampaign of terror\u201d against its activists. The Interior Ministry said it was not claiming \u201ca political conspiracy\u201d behind the arms purchase. \u201cThe Interior Ministry, along with other preventive measures, is constantly monitoring illegal turnover of arms,\u201d the Interior Ministry said in a statement. \u201cRecently several groups have been identified, which were showing interest in purchasing automatic firearms. Several members of these groups were arrested this morning. The Interior Ministry was not planning to make any statement until the end of the investigation, but some political and public organizations have responded to the incident and the issue was seriously politicized. The representatives of some political parties made tough statements. Hence, the Interior Ministry is providing to the society a part of evidence proving criminal activities of the detainees. Other evidences and information will be unveiled later.\u201d The evidence involves six separate episodes of covertly recorded footage of what seems to be a sting operation by undercover agents acting as arms dealers. In the fist footage a man identified as Giorgi Bolashvili, an activist from DMUG youth wing, negotiates with undercover agent terms for purchase of CZ-75 semi-automatic pistol for USD 400 and expresses desire to buy AKS-U submachine gun \u2013 a shortened version of Kalashnikov assault rifle. In the second footage a man identified as Bolashvili\u2019s cousin with the same first and second name \u2013 Giorgi Bolashvili meets the same undercover agent to buy the firearm. In the third episode a man identified as Vakhtang Narsia, an activist from DMUG youth wing, holding apparently UZI submachine gun, is discussing with another man \u2013 supposedly also an undercover agent \u2013 mobilization of supporters. In the fourth footage, Mamuka Shengelia, a driver of Badri Bitsadze, husband of Nino Burjanadze, is seen discussing specifications and price of various firearms with a person \u2013 apparently also an undercover agent. In the fifth and sixth footage a person identified as Giorgi Tsertsvadze is seen \u2013 his name was not listed among the DMUG\u2019s arrested activists released earlier by the party itself. Tsertsvadze, according to the Interior Ministry, was acting under the instructions of Shengelia to purchase the firearms. The sixth footage, also recorded covertly in what seems to be an apartment room, Tsertsvadze is checking various types of firearms massed in a corner of the room. Shota Utiashvili, head of the Interior Ministry\u2019s analytical department, has strongly denied any politics behind the arrest of these persons and also said that the investigation was not claiming there was \u201ca political conspiracy.\u201d \u201cWhat we know is that there are people who have showed interest in buying weapons and have bought weapons and they are arrested,\u201d Utiashvili said. Nino Burjanadze, the leader of DMUG, said after the Interior Ministry\u2019s statement that she was ready to cooperate with the investigation. She, however, said the evidence put forth by the investigation was not enough and needed further scrutiny. \u201cNot a single normal court will consider the evidences shown on TV as enough evidence to prove the charges that have been made,\u201d she told journalists. \u201cWe are familiar with such \u2018video evidence\u2019 and how they are made up. The footage needs very serious expertise. Probably the Interior Ministry will make this expertise. We will also try to make this expertise through our independent sources: when the footage was recorded, in what context, when and how the footage was edited and so on.\u201d \u201cWe are not rejecting to cooperate with the investigation,\u201d Burjanadze said and also added that the footage provided by the Interior Ministry would fail to confirm the allegations that her party was planning \u201carmed rebellion and was setting up armed groups for this purpose.\u201d Earlier this month the Georgian tabloid Alia reported that Bitsadze had a plan to set up armed groups. In an unusual move, the Rustavi 2 TV, picked up the newspaper article and covered the allegations extensively in its primetime news program on March 10. Meanwhile, it also emerged on March 23, that an activist from the Movement for Salvation of Georgia was arrested and charged with plotting a coup.

["TxDOT puts FM 678 overpass on project list. It could take a few years, but residents of START Cooke County END are hopeful a new Texas Department of Transportation construction project will help make a dangerous Highway 82 intersection safer. TxDOT reportedly approved a request to fund an overpass running east and west over Farm to Market 678 on U.S. Highway 82, said Commissioner Gary Hollowell. Hollowell said the resolution is the combined efforts of a number of concerned citizens as well as members of the commissioners court. A group of commissioners wrote the resolution and presented it to TxDOT at least two years ago, Hollowell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve attended meetings at (TxDOT\u2019s district office) in Wichita Falls where we met with a nonbinding resolution committee. We provided TxDOT with a wish list of projects we would like to see completed. The list is prioritized, but TxDOT is not obligated to do it (the projects),\u201d he said. He said county judges and representatives of municipalities often appeal for projects they believe are important. The overpass at 678 was apparently a priority for many, Hollowell said, citing efforts by county commissioners, Cooke County residents and others including Callisburg Independent School District Superintendent Dr. Charles Holloway to get the project started. \u201cThe justification for the project are the accidents and near-accidents at this intersection,\u201d he said. The project is also the result of investigation and research by TxDOT officials. \u201cTxDOT spent time doing traffic studies and installing warning indicators (at the intersection),\u201d he said. \u201cThey also increased the number of turn lanes and added exceleration lanes and striping to try to highlight the area.\u201d The project is not scheduled to begin immediately. \u201cWe think it will be let in 2010 or 2012,\u201d Hollowell said. For many, the project cannot begin soon enough. \u201cThe sooner, the better,\u201d he said. The FM 678 and Highway 82 project is one of at least construction projected slated to take place in Cooke County. The 678 project is expected to be paid for by surety bond funds. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009 Stimulus bill) is reportedly funding two addition projects. These projects include a resurfacing of portions of Interstate Highway 35 from Highway 82 to the Red River and widening FM 2071 between FM 372 and FM 922."]

["Putting children on witness stand wrenching for all. BY RUSS ZIMMER Advocate Reporter March 15, 2009 START NEWARK END -- Unfortunately, it's not an unusual sight -- a child walking toward the witness stand, usually with something in his or her grip, like a stuffed animal or an adult's hand. The child climbs up into the chair, feet not even touching the floor, preparing to talk about something of a very adult nature. Six minors took the stand in their capacity as alleged victims in rape trials in 2007 and 2008, according to data gathered by The Advocate. Many more testified against defendants facing lesser offenses or were interviewed by medical professionals and law enforcement for those cases. Over the past month, juries acquitted two men accused of sexual conduct with a child younger than 13. Doubt was cast on the strength of the state's cases, including inconsistencies in the victims' testimony compared to previous statements and the investigators' methods. Children in each case were required to divulge the alleged conduct, answer legally necessary questions and be subject to cross-examination, all in front of strangers and in front of the defendant. Licking County Prosecutor Ken Oswalt said the convergence of all these elements make an adult victim nervous, let alone a child. These factors can make their testimony unpredictable and sometimes damaging to a case, he said. For those reasons, Oswalt said his office wants to avoid putting children who already have suffered a life-changing experience in that situation. \"We're not in the business of trying to further traumatize kids.... We're in the business of trying to get people held accountable for the things they do,\" he said. After a child initially discloses abuse and it is reported to authorities, the child usually is taken to Kids' Place, which is a division of Licking Memorial Hospital. There, he or she will receive a physical exam much like any other trip to the doctor's office, but the child will be engaged in a conversation about the allegations, according to testimony in both trials. Newark police Detective Robert Huffman, who has been handling sexual offense investigations for 17 years, said the age of the child greatly affects the wording of the questions. \"The younger the child is, the more steps you have to take to guard against leading the child in any way,\" he said. \"What I try to do is let the child tell me what they want to tell me, really nothing more than that.\" Oswalt said his office tries to limit the number of interviews conducted and officials involved to minimize the embarrassment a child might feel. From Day 1, victims are offered aid through Licking County Victims' Services, which includes trial preparation, Victims' Services Director Mark Weiner said. He said his office tries to educate children about what to expect so they don't feel overwhelmed when they are called to testify. Sometimes they wonder why they have to talk to a room full of people, Weiner said. \"We tell them sometimes bad things happen and you got to go up there and tell the judge,\" he said. The relative tranquility of the witness waiting room alters the second the doors to the courtroom swing open and 14 jurors, attorneys, the judge, the court reporter and observers all are watching as the children make their way to the witness stand. Another set of eyes, the defendant's, also are fixed upon the accuser. Much of the possible inconsistencies in a child's statement might arise from this pressure, Oswalt said. Keep in mind the vast majority of these children are victimized by close relations, he added. \"That puts a young child in a situation of having competing interests or feelings -- maybe one of those is guilt,\" Oswalt said. \"It's a huge dynamic.\" Most of the discrepancies in a child's story heard in court are inconsequential to the question of guilt or innocence, he said. Children might not even consider details of the event important to an adult to be memorable, Oswalt added. \"Daddy touched me and it was yucky,\" he said referring to a typical reaction by an abused child. Huffman said he looks for authenticity in a child's statement in a number of ways, including having knowledge beyond their age. What authorities are listening for are \"things from the child that they should have no knowledge of because of their age. Those are red flags,\" Oswalt said. Consistency also can be checked by reviewing the story with the child and inserting something they didn't say to see if the child corrects them, Huffman said. Defense attorney Kristin Burkett, who represented the exonerated defendants in both unsuccessful prosecutions, grilled police on the lack of an accompanying video or audio tape with their interview notes. Time and again, she asked detectives and jurors how anyone could critique whether the interviews were conducted properly or if stark differences existed in the victim's account if there was no digital or analog record.

There, he or she will receive a physical exam much like any other trip to the doctor's office, but the child will be engaged in a conversation about the allegations, according to testimony in both trials. Newark police Detective Robert Huffman, who has been handling sexual offense investigations for 17 years, said the age of the child greatly affects the wording of the questions. \"The younger the child is, the more steps you have to take to guard against leading the child in any way,\" he said. \"What I try to do is let the child tell me what they want to tell me, really nothing more than that.\" Oswalt said his office tries to limit the number of interviews conducted and officials involved to minimize the embarrassment a child might feel. From Day 1, victims are offered aid through START Licking County END Victims' Services, which includes trial preparation, Victims' Services Director Mark Weiner said. He said his office tries to educate children about what to expect so they don't feel overwhelmed when they are called to testify. Sometimes they wonder why they have to talk to a room full of people, Weiner said. \"We tell them sometimes bad things happen and you got to go up there and tell the judge,\" he said. The relative tranquility of the witness waiting room alters the second the doors to the courtroom swing open and 14 jurors, attorneys, the judge, the court reporter and observers all are watching as the children make their way to the witness stand. Another set of eyes, the defendant's, also are fixed upon the accuser. Much of the possible inconsistencies in a child's statement might arise from this pressure, Oswalt said. Keep in mind the vast majority of these children are victimized by close relations, he added. \"That puts a young child in a situation of having competing interests or feelings -- maybe one of those is guilt,\" Oswalt said. \"It's a huge dynamic.\" Most of the discrepancies in a child's story heard in court are inconsequential to the question of guilt or innocence, he said. Children might not even consider details of the event important to an adult to be memorable, Oswalt added. \"Daddy touched me and it was yucky,\" he said referring to a typical reaction by an abused child. Huffman said he looks for authenticity in a child's statement in a number of ways, including having knowledge beyond their age. What authorities are listening for are \"things from the child that they should have no knowledge of because of their age. Those are red flags,\" Oswalt said. Consistency also can be checked by reviewing the story with the child and inserting something they didn't say to see if the child corrects them, Huffman said. Defense attorney Kristin Burkett, who represented the exonerated defendants in both unsuccessful prosecutions, grilled police on the lack of an accompanying video or audio tape with their interview notes. Time and again, she asked detectives and jurors how anyone could critique whether the interviews were conducted properly or if stark differences existed in the victim's account if there was no digital or analog record.

One juror, who spoke to The Advocate after finding a defendant not guilty, said the lack of a recording and the definitive proof it would have contained influenced his decision. Burkett called it a \"huge problem\" Wednesday in an interview with The Advocate. \"I haven't spoke to an expert that doesn't believe those interviews should be taped,\" she said. \"If they are doing their job properly, there is no reason why they wouldn't want to tape it.\" Huffman said he personally favors taping, but the county has a policy against recording victim statements in child sexual abuse cases. Oswalt said what happens before and after the tape is switched off still will be open to scrutiny by defense attorneys. He added it was \"dead wrong\" to assume a recording would eliminate that same line of questioning. \"At the end of the day, you still need to trust the experience and integrity of the social workers and officers doing the case,\" Oswalt said. Burkett agreed with Oswalt that making a child testify in court is not the ideal outcome for the child. As a defense attorney, Burkett has to find a balance of aggressiveness and tact when questioning young witnesses. She said it's not like questioning an adult witness for the state. \"I don't want to do anything I don't have to when a child is on the stand, but I still have to represent my client,\" she said. Burkett described START Licking County END as generally a \"non-plea-bargaining jurisdiction\" but said these type of cases are the exception. Judges are more amenable to a reduced charge or disclosing their sentence in order to facilitate a plea, she said. There's little debate about the social stigma attached to sex offenses committed against children, and Burkett said even a not-guilty finding can't erase public perception of a defendant. \"People's lives are changed by the mere allegation of child sex abuse, and it doesn't go away,\" she said, \"which is why I believe these cases should be investigated more thoroughly than any other case.\" The children, win or lose in court, can bounce back with a strong support system, Weiner said. \"Kids are resilient, and with love and support they make it,\" he said."]

["START Pataskala END zoning allows fire-gutted block to be redeveloped. BY CHAD KLIMACK Advocate Reporter March 29, 2009 PATASKALA -- City officials say it might not be that difficult to redevelop a burned-out block downtown. Some officials initially thought it would take a zoning variance to rebuild two gutted buildings, but that might not be the case. \"It would appear somebody will be able to build a pretty substantial building there without going through a variance at all,\" said Diane Harris, the city's planning and zoning director. A March 7 fire, which investigators have labeled an arson, gutted most of a block on the west side of South Main Street, just south of the railroad tracks. Demolition crews subsequently tore down both 341 and 345 S. Main St. One of the buildings contained a heating and cooling businesses and the other was vacant. Mayor Steve Butcher initially thought the city's zoning would make it difficult for the current property owners -- or future ones -- to rebuild. However, he said that does not appear to be the case because the city's Downtown Business zoning designation permits developers to build something similar to what once stood there. In fact, the zoning would permit one of the property owners to build a three-story building containing up to 24,750 square feet. It would allow the other one to build a three-story building with up to 3,000 square feet. One of the property owners, Fred Ashbaugh, has said he intends to take his time in deciding whether to rebuild. He said he needs to take into account the lack of parking downtown and modern safety codes, in addition to the city's zoning. The other property owner, Claude Williams, could not be reached for comment. City officials have spoken to both property owners, and Butcher said Williams might not want to rebuild. \"We don't have any knowledge Mr. Williams is looking to develop his property, but we sure hope someone is,\" Butcher said. Harris, meanwhile, said the city would be willing to help someone find grants to rebuild. \"From my own perspective, I would like to see something that is respectful of the past,\" said Harris, adding she also would like to see someone build something that meshes with the rest of downtown. Butcher, meanwhile, said he would not be surprised if it takes both property owners time to decide how to proceed. A fire gutted he and his wife Nancy's restaurant, Nutcracker Family Restaurant, in 2005, and although the couple decided to reopen, the decision was not easy, he said. \"We went through the same struggle,\" Butcher said. \"Do we rebuild or do we take the (insurance) money?\""]

["Olympic Problems in START Sochi END. According to the statements of the Olympic organizers, Russia is not going to abandon its initial plans and obligations related to the Winter Olympic Games 2014 organization in Sochi. The budgets of the Olympic projects, financed either by the state or private investors, are subjected to the review only in connection with the construction budget reduction. But the most burning issue is related to the land plot allocation of the Olympic facilities. It is worth noting that according to the law, the Program for Sochi Development and Olympic Facilities Construction and the data of the organization that carries out the Olympic facilities area planning scheme design and approval (Giprogor Federal State Unitary Enterprise), there is an already determined plot allocation for the Olympic facilities and other building with serve a function to the Olympic facilities. The land plots within the boundaries stated in the approved construction plan, are subject to withdrawal for public needs on the basis of the resolution of the Governor of Krasnodar. The land plots, as well as objects located there, are bought from the private owners on the basis of a market value appraisal report. After the IOC Valuation Committee visit to Sochi in February 2007, the authorities promised to buy land plots from inhabitants of Nizhne-Imeritinskaya Bay, whose land plots were predominantly those subject to withdrawal at the market value, but a year and a half later no land plots purchase agreements had been supplied to their owners. Although according to the laws there is a 20-day window for drafting a purchase agreement upon receipt of an appraiser's report. The department responsible for organizing the Olympic Games in the Krasnodar area responds to the official inquiries that the delays in the statutory period for drafting purchase agreements is caused by the need to update appraisal reports on the market value of the objects to be bought. It should be noted that the process of land plot title registration in Sochi is particularly inefficient in terms of time and money. For this reason many inhabitants of Nizhne-Imeritinskaya Bay haven't yet registered their land title in a proper way, or they are still in the process of registering their land title. In this case, there is no talk of market value or even of reasonable compensation; there is social tension, which has lead to numerous protests. Litigations on invalidating the resolution of the Governor of the Krasnodar area concerning land plots withdrawal haven't been realized, as a great number of legislative innovations, meant for simplifying the Olympic construction process, give opportunities for administrative discretion, when applied, but, unfortunately, at the same time they do not supply any protection of the titleholders' rights. And the judges have demonstrated their position clearly -- if a decree violates an applicant's legal rights or interests, but it formally complies with the law, there are no grounds for its invalidation. If the Olympic object arrangement only affects some insignificant part of the land plot, it is reasonable not to withdraw it in full, but to introduce a paid fixed easement, for example, i.e. a restricted right to use the land plot for public needs. Such an easement introducing procedure is organizationally simpler, and requires minimum of budget assets. In terms of the financial crisis, all the executors of the Olympic project continue to emphasize the need for costs optimization and more efficient use of the existing opportunities. Financing difficulties, significant reduction of credit assets leads to an inevitable decrease in investors, who undertake truly \"Olympic\" obligations. And the state suggests to the existing investors that construction volumes should be correspondingly increased. Thus, the Turkish company Kolin, which won the tender for constructing the sea port cargo zone, will have to equip yachting in the harbor waters now. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck."]

The department responsible for organizing the Olympic Games in the Krasnodar area responds to the official inquiries that the delays in the statutory period for drafting purchase agreements is caused by the need to update appraisal reports on the market value of the objects to be bought. It should be noted that the process of land plot title registration in Sochi is particularly inefficient in terms of time and money. For this reason many inhabitants of Nizhne-Imeritinskaya Bay haven't yet registered their land title in a proper way, or they are still in the process of registering their land title. In this case, there is no talk of market value or even of reasonable compensation; there is social tension, which has lead to numerous protests. Litigations on invalidating the resolution of the Governor of the Krasnodar area concerning land plots withdrawal haven't been realized, as a great number of legislative innovations, meant for simplifying the Olympic construction process, give opportunities for administrative discretion, when applied, but, unfortunately, at the same time they do not supply any protection of the titleholders' rights. And the judges have demonstrated their position clearly -- if a decree violates an applicant's legal rights or interests, but it formally complies with the law, there are no grounds for its invalidation. If the Olympic object arrangement only affects some insignificant part of the land plot, it is reasonable not to withdraw it in full, but to introduce a paid fixed easement, for example, i.e. a restricted right to use the land plot for public needs. Such an easement introducing procedure is organizationally simpler, and requires minimum of budget assets. In terms of the financial crisis, all the executors of the Olympic project continue to emphasize the need for costs optimization and more efficient use of the existing opportunities. Financing difficulties, significant reduction of credit assets leads to an inevitable decrease in investors, who undertake truly \"Olympic\" obligations. And the state suggests to the existing investors that construction volumes should be correspondingly increased. Thus, the Turkish company Kolin, which won the tender for constructing the sea port cargo zone, will have to equip yachting in the harbor waters now. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck."]

["START Fla. END economist casts doubt on casino job figures. The Seminoles say if lawmakers approve the agreement they signed with Gov. Crist to expand gambling, it could create 45,000 jobs and add $4.5 billion to the state's economy when new hotels and convention facilities are built. But economist Amy Baker told a House committee Friday to look at those numbers skeptically. The jobs could come at the expense of jobs lost at race tracks or existing convention centers. Also, Indian profits can't be taxed, and people could be spending money there instead of at businesses where sales are taxed."]
["Alleged drug dealer's girlfriend will testify. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. START XENIA END \u2014 The girlfriend of the alleged drug dealer who hanged himself in a Georgia jail last summer after being snared in a nationwide manhunt agreed Monday, March 30, to a plea deal that should spare her from prison. Chelsie D. Hornsburger, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of money laundering in Greene County Common Pleas Court. In exchange for her testimony against other members of a drug ring allegedly led by former Yellow Springs resident Umoja Iddi Bakari, prosecutors recommended she receive probation. The charges, both third degree felonies, carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. Hornsburger admitted to collecting drug debts on Bakari's behalf, two of which were $1,000 transactions with members of the Greene County Drug Task Force, according to court records. \"This is a good example of how someone who is naive can be sucked into a drug enterprise,\" said Suzanne Schmidt, first assistant prosecutor. Hornsburger also admitted to receiving drugs through the mail for Bakari and mailing drug payments to Arizona and California. Hornsburger met Bakari in 2007 and he told her he was a single dad. She later learned he was still married and operating a drug operation that brought marijuana and cocaine from Columbus to Yellow Springs for distribution, according to officials. Prosecutors also have indicted Bakari's wife, Bekelech M. Asefa, 26, of Canal Winchester, Ohio near Columbus, who faces 20 felony counts including racketeering and money laundering. She entered a not guilty plea to the charges earlier this month and is free without bond. Bakari fled the Columbus area last May before police raided several homes he owned there and arrested Hornsburger. Officers caught up with Bakari near Atlanta in June, but he hung himself with a T-shirt in jail shortly after his arrest. Police are still searching for Robert McDonald Jr., a former Greene County resident, who allegedly helped Bakari sell drugs.

Chelsie D. Hornsburger, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of money laundering in Greene County Common Pleas Court. In exchange for her testimony against other members of a drug ring allegedly led by former Yellow Springs resident Umoja Iddi Bakari, prosecutors recommended she receive probation.

["START South Ossetia END on edge of war. Diplomats are pushing urgent peace talks between Georgian and South Ossetian officials to avert all-out war as heavy fighting in the region killed at least a dozen yesterday. Tensions have only escalated in breakaway South Ossetia after severe violence last weekend, and show no sign of abating. The streets of the secessionist capital are reportedly abandoned and Tbilisi says the South Ossetian separatist leader has fled. In an address to the nation yesterday evening, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said he ordered a unilateral ceasefire. \u201cA few hours ago I gave an order\u0097a very painful order for a commander-in-chief to give\u0097that not a single Georgian unit, neither a police nor other unit under our control should return fire to end the very intense bombardment.\u201d \u201cWe must stop this spiral of violence.\u201d Interfax reported that Russian officials have succeeded in arranging emergency talks between Georgian and separatist officials for tomorrow. Talks scheduled for yesterday were derailed, ostensibly over a disagreement on what format the negotiations would be in. As of last night the violence was continuing, and Georgian officials denied reports that the South Ossetians had agreed to a ceasefire. Violence grew throughout week The confrontation sparked last weekend after the fiercest fighting in years left six dead. The conflict zone fell briefly quiet after that, but growing clashes have pushed the situation to the edge over the last several days. Both sides reported heavy shootouts overnight Wednesday that continued into the day. By yesterday evening, the South Ossetians counted two dead and 18 wounded. Reports put the number of Georgian dead at ten, with 50 wounded. Tbilisi says the separatists launched an attack yesterday on the Georgian-controlled villages of Nuli and Avnevi in a bid to take strategic heights overlooking the area. A Georgian armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the attacks, confirmed Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili, wounding three Georgian troops. \u201cHeavy shootings continue,\u201d he told the Messenger yesterday. The South Ossetian separatist press committee said Georgian forces attacked an Ossetian-controlled village and were pushed back from strategic hills. Late in the evening Utiashvili said that South Ossetian fighters continued to attack despite the Georgian ceasefire. The Georgian-controlled village of Prisi reportedly came under attack late last night. Separatists had claimed the day before there were Georgian artillery attacks from the heights above Prisi. Tamarasheni, a Georgian town a stone\u2019s throw from Tskhinvali, also came under fire last night, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. Accusations of preparing for war Tbilisi accuses the separatists of starting the violence. A Georgian Foreign Ministry statement yesterday said the separatists\u2019 attacks are made \u201cwith the purpose of inciting large-scale confrontation and thwarting direct dialogue.\u201d An earlier statement pointed to South Ossetian announcements of arriving volunteer fighters from the North Caucasus as further evidence they are gearing up for war. Separatist officials accuse Georgia of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of Gori, south of the conflict zone. Eyewitnesses in the area said they saw large Georgian military convoys headed toward for the region. Utiashvili, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied the deployment of missile systems but confirmed a \u201crotation of military forces near Gori.\u201d A Russian peacekeeper officer in South Ossetia told reporters yesterday that their forces recorded eight flyovers of Georgian warplanes and surveillance drones in the previous 24 hours. Yesterday\u2019s Georgian Foreign Ministry statement said Moscow shoulders much of the blame for the violence. \u201cThe only way that separatists manage to maintain their grip on power is through military, human and technical resources provided to them by the Russian Federation,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe recent developments have shown clearly that the position of the Russian Federation will be the decisive factor in how the process will unfold in the Tskhinvali region.\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister said the remarks were \u201cunfair\u201d and that Moscow is trying to mediate in the crisis to prevent more bloodshed. The Georgian president\u2019s speech, delivered after the Foreign Ministry statement was released, changed the tone on Russia\u2019s responsibility for the clashes: \u201cThe leaders of the [Russian] peacekeeping force told us a few hours ago they have completely lost control over the separatists\u2019 actions\u0085 We are in constant contact with the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s leadership.

The streets of the secessionist capital are reportedly abandoned and Tbilisi says the South Ossetian separatist leader has fled. In an address to the nation yesterday evening, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said he ordered a unilateral ceasefire. \u201cA few hours ago I gave an order\u0097a very painful order for a commander-in-chief to give\u0097that not a single Georgian unit, neither a police nor other unit under our control should return fire to end the very intense bombardment.\u201d \u201cWe must stop this spiral of violence.\u201d Interfax reported that Russian officials have succeeded in arranging emergency talks between Georgian and separatist officials for tomorrow. Talks scheduled for yesterday were derailed, ostensibly over a disagreement on what format the negotiations would be in. As of last night the violence was continuing, and Georgian officials denied reports that the South Ossetians had agreed to a ceasefire. Violence grew throughout week The confrontation sparked last weekend after the fiercest fighting in years left six dead. The conflict zone fell briefly quiet after that, but growing clashes have pushed the situation to the edge over the last several days. Both sides reported heavy shootouts overnight Wednesday that continued into the day. By yesterday evening, the South Ossetians counted two dead and 18 wounded. Reports put the number of Georgian dead at ten, with 50 wounded. Tbilisi says the separatists launched an attack yesterday on the Georgian-controlled villages of Nuli and Avnevi in a bid to take strategic heights overlooking the area. A Georgian armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the attacks, confirmed Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili, wounding three Georgian troops. \u201cHeavy shootings continue,\u201d he told the Messenger yesterday. The South Ossetian separatist press committee said Georgian forces attacked an Ossetian-controlled village and were pushed back from strategic hills. Late in the evening Utiashvili said that South Ossetian fighters continued to attack despite the Georgian ceasefire. The Georgian-controlled village of Prisi reportedly came under attack late last night. Separatists had claimed the day before there were Georgian artillery attacks from the heights above Prisi. Tamarasheni, a Georgian town a stone\u2019s throw from Tskhinvali, also came under fire last night, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. Accusations of preparing for war Tbilisi accuses the separatists of starting the violence. A Georgian Foreign Ministry statement yesterday said the separatists\u2019 attacks are made \u201cwith the purpose of inciting large-scale confrontation and thwarting direct dialogue.\u201d An earlier statement pointed to South Ossetian announcements of arriving volunteer fighters from the North Caucasus as further evidence they are gearing up for war. Separatist officials accuse Georgia of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of Gori, south of the conflict zone. Eyewitnesses in the area said they saw large Georgian military convoys headed toward for the region. Utiashvili, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied the deployment of missile systems but confirmed a \u201crotation of military forces near Gori.\u201d A Russian peacekeeper officer in South Ossetia told reporters yesterday that their forces recorded eight flyovers of Georgian warplanes and surveillance drones in the previous 24 hours. Yesterday\u2019s Georgian Foreign Ministry statement said Moscow shoulders much of the blame for the violence. \u201cThe only way that separatists manage to maintain their grip on power is through military, human and technical resources provided to them by the Russian Federation,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe recent developments have shown clearly that the position of the Russian Federation will be the decisive factor in how the process will unfold in the Tskhinvali region.\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister said the remarks were \u201cunfair\u201d and that Moscow is trying to mediate in the crisis to prevent more bloodshed.

The streets of the secessionist capital are reportedly abandoned and Tbilisi says the South Ossetian separatist leader has fled. In an address to the nation yesterday evening, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said he ordered a unilateral ceasefire. \u201cA few hours ago I gave an order\u0097a very painful order for a commander-in-chief to give\u0097that not a single Georgian unit, neither a police nor other unit under our control should return fire to end the very intense bombardment.\u201d \u201cWe must stop this spiral of violence.\u201d Interfax reported that Russian officials have succeeded in arranging emergency talks between Georgian and separatist officials for tomorrow. Talks scheduled for yesterday were derailed, ostensibly over a disagreement on what format the negotiations would be in. As of last night the violence was continuing, and START Georgian END officials denied reports that the South Ossetians had agreed to a ceasefire. Violence grew throughout week The confrontation sparked last weekend after the fiercest fighting in years left six dead. The conflict zone fell briefly quiet after that, but growing clashes have pushed the situation to the edge over the last several days. Both sides reported heavy shootouts overnight Wednesday that continued into the day. By yesterday evening, the South Ossetians counted two dead and 18 wounded. Reports put the number of Georgian dead at ten, with 50 wounded. Tbilisi says the separatists launched an attack yesterday on the Georgian-controlled villages of Nuli and Avnevi in a bid to take strategic heights overlooking the area. A Georgian armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the attacks, confirmed Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili, wounding three Georgian troops. \u201cHeavy shootings continue,\u201d he told the Messenger yesterday. The South Ossetian separatist press committee said Georgian forces attacked an Ossetian-controlled village and were pushed back from strategic hills. Late in the evening Utiashvili said that South Ossetian fighters continued to attack despite the Georgian ceasefire. The Georgian-controlled village of Prisi reportedly came under attack late last night. Separatists had claimed the day before there were Georgian artillery attacks from the heights above Prisi. Tamarasheni, a Georgian town a stone\u2019s throw from Tskhinvali, also came under fire last night, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. Accusations of preparing for war Tbilisi accuses the separatists of starting the violence. A Georgian Foreign Ministry statement yesterday said the separatists\u2019 attacks are made \u201cwith the purpose of inciting large-scale confrontation and thwarting direct dialogue.\u201d An earlier statement pointed to South Ossetian announcements of arriving volunteer fighters from the North Caucasus as further evidence they are gearing up for war. Separatist officials accuse Georgia of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of Gori, south of the conflict zone. Eyewitnesses in the area said they saw large Georgian military convoys headed toward for the region. Utiashvili, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied the deployment of missile systems but confirmed a \u201crotation of military forces near Gori.\u201d A Russian peacekeeper officer in South Ossetia told reporters yesterday that their forces recorded eight flyovers of Georgian warplanes and surveillance drones in the previous 24 hours.

Both sides reported heavy shootouts overnight Wednesday that continued into the day. By yesterday evening, the South Ossetians counted two dead and 18 wounded.

A Georgian armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the attacks, confirmed Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili, wounding three Georgian troops. \u201cHeavy shootings continue,\u201d he told the Messenger yesterday.

Separatist officials accuse Georgia of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of Gori, south of the conflict zone.

Both sides reported heavy shootouts overnight Wednesday that continued into the day. By yesterday evening, the South Ossetians counted two dead and 18 wounded. Reports put the number of Georgian dead at ten, with 50 wounded.

A Georgian armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the attacks, confirmed Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili, wounding three Georgian troops. \u201cHeavy shootings continue,\u201d he told the Messenger yesterday.

Separatist officials accuse Georgia of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of Gori, south of the conflict zone.

In an address to the nation yesterday evening, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said he ordered a unilateral ceasefire. \u201cA few hours ago I gave an order\u0097a very painful order for a commander-in-chief to give\u0097that not a single Georgian unit, neither a police nor other unit under our control should return fire to end the very intense bombardment.\u201d \u201cWe must stop this spiral of violence.\u201d Interfax reported that Russian officials have succeeded in arranging emergency talks between Georgian and separatist officials for tomorrow. Talks scheduled for yesterday were derailed, ostensibly over a disagreement on what format the negotiations would be in. As of last night the violence was continuing, and Georgian officials denied reports that the South Ossetians had agreed to a ceasefire. Violence grew throughout week The confrontation sparked last weekend after the fiercest fighting in years left six dead. The conflict zone fell briefly quiet after that, but growing clashes have pushed the situation to the edge over the last several days. Both sides reported heavy shootouts overnight Wednesday that continued into the day. By yesterday evening, the South Ossetians counted two dead and 18 wounded. Reports put the number of Georgian dead at ten, with 50 wounded. Tbilisi says the separatists launched an attack yesterday on the Georgian-controlled villages of Nuli and Avnevi in a bid to take strategic heights overlooking the area. A Georgian armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the attacks, confirmed Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili, wounding three Georgian troops. \u201cHeavy shootings continue,\u201d he told the Messenger yesterday. The South Ossetian separatist press committee said Georgian forces attacked an Ossetian-controlled village and were pushed back from strategic hills. Late in the evening Utiashvili said that South Ossetian fighters continued to attack despite the Georgian ceasefire. The Georgian-controlled village of Prisi reportedly came under attack late last night. Separatists had claimed the day before there were Georgian artillery attacks from the heights above Prisi. Tamarasheni, a Georgian town a stone\u2019s throw from Tskhinvali, also came under fire last night, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. Accusations of preparing for war Tbilisi accuses the separatists of starting the violence. A Georgian Foreign Ministry statement yesterday said the separatists\u2019 attacks are made \u201cwith the purpose of inciting large-scale confrontation and thwarting direct dialogue.\u201d An earlier statement pointed to South Ossetian announcements of arriving volunteer fighters from the North Caucasus as further evidence they are gearing up for war. Separatist officials accuse Georgia of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of Gori, south of the conflict zone. Eyewitnesses in the area said they saw large Georgian military convoys headed toward for the region. Utiashvili, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied the deployment of missile systems but confirmed a \u201crotation of military forces near Gori.\u201d A Russian peacekeeper officer in South Ossetia told reporters yesterday that their forces recorded eight flyovers of Georgian warplanes and surveillance drones in the previous 24 hours.

Tamarasheni, a Georgian town a stone\u2019s throw from Tskhinvali, also came under fire last night, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. Accusations of preparing for war Tbilisi accuses the separatists of starting the violence.

The Georgian president\u2019s speech, delivered after the Foreign Ministry statement was released, changed the tone on Russia\u2019s responsibility for the clashes: \u201cThe leaders of the [Russian] peacekeeping force told us a few hours ago they have completely lost control over the separatists\u2019 actions\u0085 We are in constant contact with the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s leadership.

Tbilisi urges talks after negotiations fail Georgia\u2019s top official for conflict issues, Temur Iakobashvili, told reporters that hoped-for talks fell through after he traveled to the conflict zone yesterday, where South Ossetian representatives refused to meet him. \u201cTskhinvali looked empty, as I know [separatist leader Eduard] Kokoity has left the town,\u201d Iakobashvili said, adding that Russia\u2019s own envoy was not able to reach Tskhinvali due to car troubles.

A Georgian Foreign Ministry statement yesterday said the separatists\u2019 attacks are made \u201cwith the purpose of inciting large-scale confrontation and thwarting direct dialogue.\u201d An earlier statement pointed to South Ossetian announcements of arriving volunteer fighters from the North Caucasus as further evidence they are gearing up for war. Separatist officials accuse Georgia of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of Gori, south of the conflict zone. Eyewitnesses in the area said they saw large Georgian military convoys headed toward for the region. Utiashvili, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied the deployment of missile systems but confirmed a \u201crotation of military forces near Gori.\u201d A Russian peacekeeper officer in South Ossetia told reporters yesterday that their forces recorded eight flyovers of Georgian warplanes and surveillance drones in the previous 24 hours. Yesterday\u2019s Georgian Foreign Ministry statement said Moscow shoulders much of the blame for the violence. \u201cThe only way that separatists manage to maintain their grip on power is through military, human and technical resources provided to them by the Russian Federation,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe recent developments have shown clearly that the position of the Russian Federation will be the decisive factor in how the process will unfold in the Tskhinvali region.\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister said the remarks were \u201cunfair\u201d and that Moscow is trying to mediate in the crisis to prevent more bloodshed. The Georgian president\u2019s speech, delivered after the Foreign Ministry statement was released, changed the tone on Russia\u2019s responsibility for the clashes: \u201cThe leaders of the [Russian] peacekeeping force told us a few hours ago they have completely lost control over the separatists\u2019 actions\u0085 We are in constant contact with the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s leadership. The Russian Foreign Ministry is trying\u0097they say they are trying, but not succeeding\u0097to get the separatists to cease fire.\u201d Georgia is Russia\u2019s \u201cnatural ally,\u201d said Saakashvili. Tbilisi urges talks after negotiations fail Georgia\u2019s top official for conflict issues, Temur Iakobashvili, told reporters that hoped-for talks fell through after he traveled to the conflict zone yesterday, where South Ossetian representatives refused to meet him. \u201cTskhinvali looked empty, as I know [separatist leader Eduard] Kokoity has left the town,\u201d Iakobashvili said, adding that Russia\u2019s own envoy was not able to reach Tskhinvali due to car troubles.

["80-year-old killed in START Arlington END by neighbor backing up. An 80-year-old woman was killed this morning in Arlington when a neighbor accidentally hit her while backing out of a driveway. The woman was walking the 3800 block of Silkwood Trail in South Arlington about 7 a.m. when the collission occured, said Tiara Ellis, an Arlington spokeswoman. She was struck by an SUV driven by a female neighbor. The driver was leaving to take her 15-year-old son to school, Ellis said, when she felt resistance while backing out of the driveway. After pulling the car forward, she saw the 80-year-old. The son called 911. Ellis said the driver told police that while she'd seen the elderly woman walking in the neighborhood before, she didn't see her when she started backing out of the driveway today. Poor visibility related to the rain may have been a factor, police said. Police are still investigating, but no criminal charges are expected. \u201cIt looks like it was just an unfortunate accident,\u201d Ellis said."]
