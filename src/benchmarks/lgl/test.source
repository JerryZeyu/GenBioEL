[" START Gainesville END residents march in protest of Charter Amendment 1. Toting signs that said \u201cVote no on 1\u201d and \u201cEquality for all,\u201d about 55 Gainesville residents marched Friday near the intersection of Northwest Eighth Avenue and Northwest 34th Street. The protesters opposed Charter Amendment 1, which would remove Gainesville\u2019s existing discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity, said Shelbi Day, a marcher and the director of communications and media for Equality is Gainesville\u2019s Business, which opposes the amendment. The march, which went along Northwest 8th Avenue for about 15 minutes followed by a sign\u0096holding demonstration at the intersection, included Gainesville parents, children, church members, faculty and students. Day said the march aimed to let locals know that Gainesville says \u201cno\u201d to discrimination. On the other hand, Micanopy resident Troy Blakely, who held a sign in favor of the amendment near the Supervisor of Elections Office during early voting on Saturday, said the amendment should be passed because it represents a public safety issue and would protect against sexual predators. Art Ellingsen, a Gainesville resident and a member of the pro\u0096amendment group Citizens for Good Public Policy, referenced the group\u2019s commercial depicting a man entering a women\u2019s restroom. He said he worries about the safety of his baby granddaughter when she visits him if the amendment does not pass.

["Luminaries don't yet see light. If a recent blue-ribbon confab for business leaders, analysts and economists is any indication, START Canadians END who believe the Great Crash will be over soon should probably think about changing meds. An international poll just out shows that despite all the economic doom and gloom -- not to mention terminal winter blahs -- Canadians are among the most optimistic people in the world. The Environics survey, for instance, found 70% of Canucks don't expect the recession to last more than two years. But among those most likely in the know, there is a growing crescendo of expert opinion that anyone who still sees the global economic glass as half-full must be drinking the other half, and it ain't water. Yesterday, Parliament's watchdog of fiscal funny business, federal budget officer Kevin Page, told a Commons committee the Conservative government's latest projections are already being washed away in a tidal wave of red ink. He predicts federal deficits and unemployment will be far higher than government projections as the economy continues to tank. Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, who recently predicted the economy would bounce back by the end of the year, is now signalling he, too, is tossing the rose-coloured glasses. But the really depressing news came out of a closed-door symposium in Toronto this week exploring \"what lies ahead for the global economy.\" The conclusion is the current global malaise will be much deeper, last much longer, and be far more complicated to cure than most governments are willing to admit. The road to recovery, the experts are saying, is anything but around the corner. Think at least three to five years away. The iconic David Dodge, former Bank of Canada governor and a federal deputy minister of finance for years before that, told the ballroom full of corporate execs that the economy is toast this year, and going to get worse before it gets any better. \"The year 2009 is going to be a very dark page in economic history,\" Dodge told the pinstripe crowd that became decidedly downcast as the day progressed. Dodge agrees with the need for major deficit spending to keep the economy moving in the wake of both business and consumer spending going to the bottom. \"There is virtually nothing policy-makers can do in the coming months that will do anything to affect (economic) outcomes this year,\" Dodge said. Similarly, there will be no instant miracles from the central banks' cutting their key lending rates to near zero. Dodge said even in good economic times when the market is awash with borrowing and spending, interest rate cuts can take nine months or more to have their desired impact. That delay could be even longer in this so-called \"balance sheet recession,\" when economies shift from borrowing and spending to saving and debt reduction. One result, Dodge said, would likely be global unemployment continuing to climb into 2010. Other luminaries speaking at the Toronto symposium included Richard Koo, chief economist for Nomura Securities in Tokyo; Martin Wolf, associate editor of the Financial Times of London; and William A. Macdonald, a Toronto-based strategic consultant and one of this country's engaging thinkers. While they didn't address Canada's economic problems directly -- the fiscal fate of this country, like others, is in the hands of the U.S. and China -- it seems clear the odds of the federal government returning to balanced budgets in the next five years are slim to nil. As for your decimated stock portfolio, don't expect it to bounce back to where it was anytime soon -- apparently about 40% of its value was just air in the bubble now burst."]

According to police, Taleferio was at a party with friends and may have gotten into an altercation with another group of teens. After he left the party with his friends, their red 1991 Honda broke down and they stopped at an Exxon gas station on Mayfield Road and State Highway 360 to fix it. A red Dodge Durango with a group of teens who may have been at the party also drove to the gas station and started fighting with Taleferio and his friends. Taleferio and his friends left the gas station and stopped about a half-mile away at a light at Forum Drive and Mayfield Road in Grand Prairie when the Durango pulled up next to them. Shots fired from the Durango struck Taleferio in the back of the head, police said. The Honda's driver, another 16-year-old, also was struck and suffered non-life threatening injuries. The injured teen drove to USMD Medical Center in Arlington, and Taleferio was later airlifted to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth where he was pronounced dead, authorities said."]

[" START Henderson END , Boulder City to weigh police, fire facility. The Boulder City Council on Tuesday will consider continuing plans to build a public safety training facility for police and firefighters in the Eldorado Valley. If the council approves a memorandum of understanding with Henderson, the cities will move forward with joint development of the 720-acre training grounds, a project nearly 10 years in the works. Henderson has $1 million set aside for the $6 million project, said Keith Paul, a spokesman for the Henderson Police Department. The agreement wouldn't place any timelines for construction, but it would mean the cities would continue looking for funding in future appropriation bills, Boulder City Manager Vicki Mayes said. \"It's the first step in the process,\" she said. In 2007, Boulder City dedicated $150,000 for the master plan of the training grounds to be built near Silver State Materials off U.S. 95, just north of the dry lake bed, Mayes said. At the council meeting, Poggemeyer Design Group will present that master plan. The facility would have pistol, rifle and shotgun ranges, repelling towers, and a track for emergency vehicle operators to train, Boulder City Police Chief Thomas Finn said. Boulder City and Henderson would allow other police and fire agencies to use the facility for a fee, he said. Mayes said $600,000 for the project recently was recently approved through the Legislature's omnibus bill. Finn said pairing with Henderson on the project is ideal. \"Henderson has money and we have land,\" he said. \"It's a perfect location because it will probably be surrounded some day by solar energy plants, never homes and businesses, so no one will ever complain about the shooting ranges.\""]

[" START Montana END airplane crash victims had Laurel ties. Four of the 14 passengers who died in an airline crash in Montana Sunday had ties to Laurel County.

Brent Ching, a dentist, was the son of Phyllis Chu, Caleb Chu\u2019s daughter. While Phyllis Chu was raised in Clay County, Ching grew up in California. His uncle Perry Chu, who attended Laurel County High School, also lives out west. Priscilla Chu said she spoke to Perry, an anesthesiologist, Sunday. \u201cHe was in bad shape and was in shock,\u201d she said. As to how she felt, Priscilla Chu just answered, \u201cHow would you feel?\u201d Chu visited the Ching family in August and said the kids were a joy. \u201cThey were so young, they loved everybody,\u201d she said.

["County lifts burn ban.

With the discontinuation of the burn ban, all Walker County residents will now be allowed to conduct outdoor burns.

While the permits will negate any legal concerns for residents, January said the community is still encouraged to keep in contact with the local fire department to stay aware of any future burn bans. \u201cEven though we received some rain over the last week, we can\u2019t predict conditions for the area in the next few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on how much rain we receive in the next few weeks, the burn ban could go back into effect.\u201d According to January, 190 of approximately 250 counties in the state are still under burn bans, but the change in soil saturation seen in Walker County has allowed the local ban to be lifted. \u201cThough we have lifted our burn ban for the time being, we still want to make sure everybody is being really careful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful we\u2019re able to do this now, primarily because it allows us to clear out a lot of debris, trash and wood that has piled up since January. \u201cStill, we want people to exercise caution as we\u2019re probably going to have some controlled burns get out of control, even with this amount of rain.\u201d Walker County residents are also asked to be considerate of their neighbors while burning, as certain items to be burned may produce high amounts of smoke. \u201cWe have a definite concern with the amount of wetness in things that might be burned,\u201d January said. \u201cThings like sticks, brush and leaves are all wet right now, and when people try to light those things on fire, they\u2019re going to create a lot of smoke. \u201cWe just want everyone to think about their neighbors whenever they\u2019re burning.\u201d"]

Those residents living within Huntsville city limits, however, will be required to obtain an updated burning permit from the fire department. \u201cGrisham and Pierce met today and lifted the burn ban on county, so anybody in the county is allowed to burn,\u201d said Jason January with the Huntsville Fire Department. \u201cOn the 14-day outlook, it shows us being out of immediate fire danger, and while different parts of the county have received different amounts of rain, we\u2019ve dropped an average of two hazard classes as an entire county.\u201d Residents of Huntsville will be able to pick up a burning permit \u2014 which is mandatory for city residents who plan to burn \u2014 at either of the city\u2019s fire stations, January said. \u201cWhile the burn ban has been lifted, people who live in the city will still need to come by Huntsville Fire Station 1 or 2 to obtain a new burning permit,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is necessary because all burning permits expire once a burn ban has been enacted.\u201d January said the burning permits, which are free to the public, will allow the permit holders to burn for 60 days. While the permits will negate any legal concerns for residents, January said the community is still encouraged to keep in contact with the local fire department to stay aware of any future burn bans. \u201cEven though we received some rain over the last week, we can\u2019t predict conditions for the area in the next few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on how much rain we receive in the next few weeks, the burn ban could go back into effect.\u201d According to January, 190 of approximately 250 counties in the state are still under burn bans, but the change in soil saturation seen in Walker County has allowed the local ban to be lifted. \u201cThough we have lifted our burn ban for the time being, we still want to make sure everybody is being really careful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful we\u2019re able to do this now, primarily because it allows us to clear out a lot of debris, trash and wood that has piled up since January. \u201cStill, we want people to exercise caution as we\u2019re probably going to have some controlled burns get out of control, even with this amount of rain.\u201d Walker County residents are also asked to be considerate of their neighbors while burning, as certain items to be burned may produce high amounts of smoke. \u201cWe have a definite concern with the amount of wetness in things that might be burned,\u201d January said. \u201cThings like sticks, brush and leaves are all wet right now, and when people try to light those things on fire, they\u2019re going to create a lot of smoke. \u201cWe just want everyone to think about their neighbors whenever they\u2019re burning.\u201d"]

[" START Riverbanks END welcomes three black- necked swan cygnets . The cygnets only spent about a day in the nest. By Saturday they ventured into the water with their parents in search of food. Unlike birds that nest in trees, the offspring of waterfowl are known as \"precocial\" species, which means they hatch with feathers, can see, and can feed themselves. The fluffy white chicks are currently on exhibit with their parents in the pond at Riverbanks' Bird Garden (opposite the Bird Conservation Center). Guests will most likely see them swimming around the exhibit or catching a ride on the back of one of their parents; you may have to look closely though, sometimes they tuck under their parents' wings for protection. This is the first set of offspring for the pair. The male, 9, came to Riverbanks in 2000 from the Santa Ana Zoo and the female, 5, came in 2004 from the Alexandria Zoo. Both animals are considered young parents, as swans can live into their 40s. The pair began nestbuilding in early January. The swans start by sitting on the ground and pulling organic material toward their bodies to build a nest up around them. The result is a conical- shaped shell. The birds then line it with feathers plucked from their own body to serve as insulation for the eggs when the parents are not on the nest. The cygnets, which are currently covered in down feathers, will begin growing juvenile feathers in two months."]

["Class has lesson on history, art. START Paris END and Henry County is rich in both history and art opportunities and the Lee Academy for the Arts is an example of how both are thriving here. The 2008-09 Leadership Henry County class had the opportunity to tour the Lee Academy building during its Wednesday session. Every time I visit Lee Academy, I am impressed by its beautiful hardwood floors and old-fashioned facade. The feet of thousands of youngsters have trod on those floors, and as we recently heard, the feet of little ones still grace the classrooms there where dancing, drama and music classes keep the school alive with artistic activity. The school also has a wide variety of youth and adult classes such as painting, pottery, photography, ballroom dancing, yoga and piano lessons. Ray Harding of the Lee School Association gave a presentation showing how far the school building has come since 2001 when the association formed a committee dedicated to preserving the school. These people who invested their hearts and souls into seeing the school brought back to its original glory were former students of the school and also people who had a love of Paris history. In 2002, a feasibility study was done to determine the best use for the building, and in 2003 the association decided to use the building for the arts. \u201cWe went about this in a pretty organized way,\u201d said Harding. \u201cSomebody suggested making luxury apartments out of the building, but we didn\u2019t want to do that because it would ruin the flavor of the school.\u201d The first two classrooms opened for use in 2004. Since then, the entire building has undergone renovation with several upstairs classrooms being rented out to local artists. The Lunchroom at Lee is the most recent exciting renovation to the building, which is a room with a kitchen, stage and audio system that can be rented for special events like dinners and receptions, performances and meetings. As Harding showed the class before and after pictures of the renovations, audible gasps could be heard because of the remarkable transformation of this historical house of learning. Lee Academy serves about 300 students a year and teachers are both paid and volunteer. The total cost of the renovation was $350,000; the debt remaining is about $43,000. Harding said the association hopes to receive more members who want to financially help the school, and also hopes the Lunchroom rentals will be able to help the school financially. \u201cWe have two hundred members, which is pretty good, and we appreciate all of them,\u201d he said. More information about the school can be found on its Web site at . We also met with Stephanie Tayloe, county archivist, who showed us several interesting documents in the county archives located at the Central Community Service Center on Jones Bend Road Extended. Some of the documents there date back to almost 200 years ago. \u201cThe archives here are a hidden treasure of Henry County,\u201d said Tayloe. \u201cPeople do not realize the importance of these papers.\u201d She has been involved with archiving the county records for about 12 years. \u201cI love it and I hope I can do it for the rest of my life,\u201d she said. The boxes and boxes of records previously were stored in the attic of the Henry County Courthouse where pigeons, mice and other varmints wreaked havoc on them for years. About 14 years ago, the process of cleaning and archiving the records began, and even though countless hours of work have been dedicated to the cause, there is still work to be done. \u201cIt\u2019s been a labor of love,\u201d said Tayloe. Linda Dunlap also works with the archives. \u201cWe work all of the time and it\u2019s one hundred percent volunteer,\u201d said Dunlap. The archivists transcribe the documents, type them up and file them on a computer and make books out of them \u2014 some of which can be purchased. Tayloe showed several documents which have historical significance and several boxes of estate settlements going back to the 1820s. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a Southerner yet who wasn\u2019t done wrong by the will,\u201d Tayloe said smiling. \u201cThey squabble over everything right down to the last iron skillet.\u201d Earlier in the day the class also heard a presentation by David Webb, county historian; toured the Krider Performing Arts Center; toured the genealogy department at Rhea Public Library; heard a presentation by Mary Lodge, Paris-Henry County Arts Council director; and toured the Paris-Henry County Heritage Center with director Norma Steele (a.k.a. \u201cNaughty Norma\u201d). Art is imitating life and history is in the making in Henry County."]

These people who invested their hearts and souls into seeing the school brought back to its original glory were former students of the school and also people who had a love of Paris history. In 2002, a feasibility study was done to determine the best use for the building, and in 2003 the association decided to use the building for the arts. \u201cWe went about this in a pretty organized way,\u201d said Harding. \u201cSomebody suggested making luxury apartments out of the building, but we didn\u2019t want to do that because it would ruin the flavor of the school.\u201d The first two classrooms opened for use in 2004. Since then, the entire building has undergone renovation with several upstairs classrooms being rented out to local artists. The Lunchroom at Lee is the most recent exciting renovation to the building, which is a room with a kitchen, stage and audio system that can be rented for special events like dinners and receptions, performances and meetings. As Harding showed the class before and after pictures of the renovations, audible gasps could be heard because of the remarkable transformation of this historical house of learning. Lee Academy serves about 300 students a year and teachers are both paid and volunteer. The total cost of the renovation was $350,000; the debt remaining is about $43,000. Harding said the association hopes to receive more members who want to financially help the school, and also hopes the Lunchroom rentals will be able to help the school financially. \u201cWe have two hundred members, which is pretty good, and we appreciate all of them,\u201d he said. More information about the school can be found on its Web site at . We also met with Stephanie Tayloe, county archivist, who showed us several interesting documents in the county archives located at the Central Community Service Center on Jones Bend Road Extended. Some of the documents there date back to almost 200 years ago. \u201cThe archives here are a hidden treasure of Henry County,\u201d said Tayloe. \u201cPeople do not realize the importance of these papers.\u201d She has been involved with archiving the county records for about 12 years. \u201cI love it and I hope I can do it for the rest of my life,\u201d she said. The boxes and boxes of records previously were stored in the attic of the Henry County Courthouse where pigeons, mice and other varmints wreaked havoc on them for years. About 14 years ago, the process of cleaning and archiving the records began, and even though countless hours of work have been dedicated to the cause, there is still work to be done. \u201cIt\u2019s been a labor of love,\u201d said Tayloe. Linda Dunlap also works with the archives. \u201cWe work all of the time and it\u2019s one hundred percent volunteer,\u201d said Dunlap. The archivists transcribe the documents, type them up and file them on a computer and make books out of them \u2014 some of which can be purchased. Tayloe showed several documents which have historical significance and several boxes of estate settlements going back to the 1820s. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a Southerner yet who wasn\u2019t done wrong by the will,\u201d Tayloe said smiling. \u201cThey squabble over everything right down to the last iron skillet.\u201d Earlier in the day the class also heard a presentation by David Webb, county historian; toured the Krider Performing Arts Center; toured the genealogy department at Rhea Public Library; heard a presentation by Mary Lodge, Paris-Henry County Arts Council director; and toured the Paris-Henry County Heritage Center with director Norma Steele (a.k.a. \u201cNaughty Norma\u201d).

["New twist develops in Fairfield hearing. A new plea agreement is \u201cat least being discussed\u201d for Elizabeth Fairfield, a START Lebanon END woman accused of murdering her daughter, Brittany, in June 2007. Robert Schembs, one of four lawyers on Fairfield\u2019s defense team, told Superior Court II Judge Rebecca McClure a deal was possible during an initial hearing Thursday. \u201cI think if we resolve it, it will be sooner rather than later,\u201d Schembs said. Specifics will follow Thursday\u2019s hearing, he told McClure. Initial hearings are when defendants formally learn what crimes they are accused of committing. Fairfield was already in jail after being indicted by a Circuit Court grand jury in November 2008 for allegedly giving Brittany a lethal dose of tramadol, a prescription pain killer. Additional charges of reckless homicide, neglect of a dependent and lying to police were filed against Fairfield on March 16. McClure gave attorneys until 11 a.m. April 24, when an hearing to review evidence is scheduled, to approve a plea agreement. Fairfield\u2019s trial is to start at 8:30 a.m. May 4 and last five days. McClure said she anticipates the trial \u201cwould require substantially more jurors\u201d than usually called for in a Superior II trial. \u201cIt costs us more than $1,000 just to get a jury here,\u201d she said. Fairfield\u2019s lawyers have already tried to keep the new charges from being field and still question whether the new charges are \u201ctechnically legal,\u201d Schembs said. There are \u201cpropriety issues\u201d over the grand jury\u2019s indictment, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure at this point what they were presented with and what they weren\u2019t; what they did and what they didn\u2019t,\u201d Schembs said. McClure had rejected a motion to strike the new charges, saying the defense had based the request on an out-dated state law. \u201cA new motion to strike is pending,\u201d Schembs said. If the new charges stand, and if she is convicted on all four counts, Fairfield could spend up to 98 years in prison and be fined $35,000. Fairfield has rejected one plea agreement. On Jan. 20, Prosecutor Todd Meyer offered to have her confess to reckless homicide. If she had accepted, and agreed to attend parenting and prescription drug treatment classes, Fairfield would have been released that day. Fairfield declined to plead, maintaining her innocence."]
["Body ID'd, cause of death unknown. The frozen body found earlier this week along the shore of Lake Opechee in START Laconia END has been identified as that of a Laconia man who went missing nearly three months ago. But the police still aren't sure how Bryan Harman, 28, died. The state medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy yesterday, identifying the body as Harman's. The autopsy found nothing suspicious - no wounds or signs of violence - and it could be months before toxicology reports come back, said Laconia police Capt. William Clary. \"There's nothing sticking out,\" Clary said. He said the autopsy also did not determine how long ago Harman had died, but \"we're saying at least several months.\" Harman was last seen on New Year's Eve. He had a fight with his girlfriend, his mother said when she called the police the next day to report him missing. The police began to investigate. Flyers were posted around Laconia. The police tracked Harman's cell phone and credit cards, but they weren't used, Clary said. Harman never picked up a paycheck from work. Months passed, and no one called to report anything, Clary said. On Wednesday, two people walking along nearby railroad tracks and searching the area for bottles spotted a body by the lake's shoreline. It was partly in the water and partly covered in ice, Clary said. The body, which was fully clothed, likely wasn't visible until recently, as snow began to melt, Clary said. The medical examiner's office took the body, and an autopsy was scheduled. Though an identification hadn't been made, Harman was the only missing person report that the Laconia police had pending, and they contacted his family to let them know a body had been found. \"We wanted to make sure they knew we were doing everything we could,\" Clary said. During the autopsy, the medical examiner was able to identify Harman with information his family had previously provided, including \"tattoos, body piercings, very good clothing description,\" Clary said. \"We had all that stuff on hand.\" Harman also had his wallet, including an ID from Alaska. Clary said Harman lived in Alaska \"for some period of time\" and said he thought Harman's father lived there also. Harman is listed as living on Dartmouth Street in Laconia. Yesterday morning, before the autopsy had been conducted, a woman answered the phone and identified herself as Harman's ex-girlfriend. She said she was \"assuming the worst.\" She said she hadn't heard from him since Dec. 31."]

["Body ID'd, cause of death unknown. The frozen body found earlier this week along the shore of Lake Opechee in Laconia has been identified as that of a Laconia man who went missing nearly three months ago. But the police still aren't sure how Bryan Harman, 28, died. The state medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy yesterday, identifying the body as Harman's. The autopsy found nothing suspicious - no wounds or signs of violence - and it could be months before toxicology reports come back, said Laconia police Capt. William Clary. \"There's nothing sticking out,\" Clary said. He said the autopsy also did not determine how long ago Harman had died, but \"we're saying at least several months.\" Harman was last seen on New Year's Eve. He had a fight with his girlfriend, his mother said when she called the police the next day to report him missing. The police began to investigate. Flyers were posted around Laconia. The police tracked Harman's cell phone and credit cards, but they weren't used, Clary said. Harman never picked up a paycheck from work. Months passed, and no one called to report anything, Clary said. On Wednesday, two people walking along nearby railroad tracks and searching the area for bottles spotted a body by the lake's shoreline. It was partly in the water and partly covered in ice, Clary said. The body, which was fully clothed, likely wasn't visible until recently, as snow began to melt, Clary said.

["Five appear in court on St Patrick's Day violence charges. FIVE men have appeared in court in relation to allegations of a series of disturbances on St Patrick's Day. The men, ranging in age from 18 to 23, were brought before START Tipperary END District Court yesterday on charges relating to incidents on March 17 last on Main Street and Abbey Street in Tipperary town. Three of the men were granted bail in open court -- despite objections from gardai who feared they would attempt to intimidate witnesses -- while bail hearings in relation to the other two were held in camera. The hearings held behind closed doors involved Patrick O'Keeffe (19) of 19 St Ailbe's Drive, Tipperary, who is accused of carrying out assault causing harm, assault, and two breaches of the Public Order Act and Jimmy Delaney (23) of 1 Carrowclough, Tipperary, who is also accused of a breach of the Public Order Act as well as assault causing harm and escaping from custody at Abbey Street, Tipperary, on March 17. Dan Delaney (18) and Ned Delaney (21), both of 1 Carrowclough, Tipperary, had been in custody since last week on charges of being intoxicated in a public place, using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and assaulting or threatening to assault a garda carrying out their duty. John-Paul Delaney (18) of Upper Abbey Street, Cahir, is charged with assault, assault causing harm and theft of a mobile phone at Main Street, Tipperary, on the same date. The court heard that he was arrested after four gardai entered his address while he was in bed, during a major garda operation on Tuesday. Opposing bail in respect of Dan Delaney, John-Paul Delaney and Ned Delaney, Detective Inspector William Leahy said that there was \"a larger group\" of people who were involved in a number of incidents of intimidation over the last year. Following the incidents on St Patrick's Day, he had looked back over files of complaints, \"and a pattern has arisen where witnesses who made complaints about assaults either refused to make statements or, having made those statements, subsequently came into the garda station and withdrew them, and that's my fear today\". \"It's the State's contention,\" said Inspector Pascal Feeney, \"that over the past 12 months a number of injured parties or witnesses have withdrawn their statements as a result of intimidation and fear.\" The applications for bail were made by solicitors Vincent McCormack and Philip English. Judge Anderson said, in relation to the case involving Dan Delaney, that it was up to the State to stand up any evidence of past intimidation and, as they could not do this, he was precluded from refusing bail. The same applied in the other cases he heard in open court."]

["More rain on the way Tuesday night. A day after the state\u2019s climatologist declared the drought officially over in most of north START Georgia END , the first of two more rain-making weather systems pushed toward metro Atlanta early Tuesday. The National Weather Service said a frontal system will likely produce an inch of rain across north Georgia late Tuesday into Wednesday, with as much as 3 to 4 inches of rain possible across central and southern parts of the state. The rain should taper off Wednesday night, with another cold front arriving late Thursday, forecasters said. That system \u201calso seems to be a good precipitiation producer, with another 1 to 2 inches expected,\u201d the Weather Service said.

Except for the Lake Lanier and Lake Hartwell basins, \u201cthe remainder of north Georgia is drought-free,\u201d Stooksbury said. The Weather Service has recorded 7.12 inches of rain so far this month at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, a surplus of 1.89 inches. For the year, the city\u2019s official rain gauge has tallied 13.70 inches of rain, only 1.24 inches below normal.

The Weather Service has recorded 7.12 inches of rain so far this month at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, a surplus of 1.89 inches. For the year, the city\u2019s official rain gauge has tallied 13.70 inches of rain, only 1.24 inches below normal. The forecast for metro Atlanta calls for mostly cloudy skies, with a 40 percent chance of showers and highs in the low 60s Tuesday afternoon. The chance of rain jumps to 100 percent overnight, before falling back to 30 percent on Wednesday. Lows Tuesday night will be in the low 50s, followed by highs Wednesday in the upper 60s. Thursday will begin mostly sunny, with a 40 percent chance of shower and thunderstorms during the afternoon, when highs will be in the mid-70s, the Weather Service said. A 90 percent chance of rain is predicted for Thursday night, along with lows around 50 degrees. Partly sunny skies, highs in the upper 60s and a 20 percent chance of showers are forecast for Friday.

["More rain on the way Tuesday night. A day after the state\u2019s climatologist declared the drought officially over in most of north Georgia, the first of two more rain-making weather systems pushed toward metro Atlanta early Tuesday.

Council staff will be driving environmentally friendly vehicles when they are out on business after a new scheme was launched this week. The cars will run on bio-fuel - recycled cooking oil - and it is hoped the move will cut costs as well as reducing carbon emissions. If the pilot scheme - believed to be a national first - is successful it will be rolled out and staff will no longer need to use their own cars for work. Councillor David Trigg, cabinet member for traffic, transport and parking, said it was part of the authority\u2019s vision for a sustainable and integrated travel plan. \"The use of bio-fuel from used cooking oil adds extra value. The council runs its current fleet of vehicles on this fuel and this is a natural progression. \u201cThe message is clear - fundamental changes in the way we use private, shared and public transport are needed in order to fulfil the need to cut carbon emissions and tackle global warming. It's infinitely better to tackle the issues while we still have a choice. \u201cUnder the proposed scheme one pool car will provide transport for up to eight council officers, making a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions and traffic congestion.\u201d"]
["Regional Water Group meets in START Mount Pleasant END . The North East Texas Regional Water Planning Group (NETRWPG) held a meeting Wednesday afternoon at the Mount Pleasant Civic Center. Engineering Consultant Ray Flemons reviewed the status of draft reports on regional water supply planning for the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Regional Water Plan to be completed in 2011. There was considerable discussion on the population projections. Flemons said that, while the TWDB at this date would not allow any change in the population figures for each county, his firm recommended changing the estimates within counties. He said the Texas State Demographer feels population is shifting from rural areas into cities above the 5,000 level. Board members decided that, rather than change the methodology of making population estimates, they would stay with the current figures until revised by the 2010 federal census. Another report being prepared is on the utilization of the region's brackish water, reported Flemons. The draft reports will be ready by mid-May, he said, in time for board members to read them before the next meeting. The board also heard a presentation from the City of Canton, which is planning to build a new city reservoir to meet it projected population needs.

["Flood uses Lincoln portrayer to illustrate talk. When author Bracelen Flood speaks, he rarely has a Lincoln impersonator to use as a prop. However, as the author addressed a crowd of more than 220 Wednesday evening in the Grand Reading Room of Eastern START Kentucky END University\u2019s library, Flood called upon living history portrayer Bob Coffey to illustrate a scene depicted in his latest book, \u201c1864: Lincoln at the Gates of History.\u201d When the 12,000-man force of Confederate Gen. Jubal Early threatened the capital, coming to within five miles of the White House, Lincoln visited the capital\u2019s defenders at Fort Stevens, about five miles from the White House. Climbing upon the fort\u2019s parapet, the 6-foot, 4-inch Lincoln, wearing his trademark stovepipe hat, presented a 7-foot silhouette at which Confederate snipers could aim. To illustrate, Flood asked Coffey to stand. The Rockcastle County resident is the same height as Lincoln and almost the same age as the president was in 1864. Wearing a stovepipe hat, Coffey appeared giant-like to the audience. In contrast, the average Union soldier\u2019s height was only 5 feet, 6 inches. Lincoln probably is the only U.S. president to come under war-time fire while in office, Flood said. Captured Confederates later said their snipers recognized Lincoln\u2019s unmistakable profile, but all of their bullets missed the president who would be felled by an assassin\u2019s bullet the following year after the soldiers\u2019 guns had fallen silent. Lincoln lived long enough, however, to stiffen the nation\u2019s resolve in the face of military disasters, win re-election and see the Union to victory, Flood said. \u201cHow did Lincoln get his reputation for honesty?\u201d a questioner asked after Flood\u2019s address. Alluding to scandals of the past 35 years that have sent three Illinois governors to prison and led to another\u2019s indictment and impeachment, \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard for an Illinois politician to acquire a reputation for honesty,\u201d Flood said to much laughter. An elementary school student asked Flood what he found most interesting about Lincoln. The president set aside three hours every day for citizens to meet him in his office, Flood said. \u201cHe would see about 50 people each day in the order they arrived, regardless of who they were,\u201d the author said. Lincoln also had every letter sent to him answered, and penned a few answers himself. Those gestures allowed visitors from all over the country, even from as far as California, to see \u201cThere was a real person in the White House who care about them,\u201d Flood said. That helped stiffened the nation\u2019s spine when many in the North were ready to give up on the war, he said. Flood\u2019s presentation took place in the library where he has researched four books over the past 35 years. \u201cI am (in the Library) so much of the time that I regard the staff as my friends,\u201d Flood wrote in the acknowledgments of the Lincoln book. The nationally acclaimed writer has worked in some of the nation\u2019s largest and most prestigious libraries, including the Library of Congress, the Harvard University library and the New York Public Library. \u201cWhat I have (at EKU) makes me competitive with people working in any university or large public library anywhere in the country,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in a room at New York Public Library reserved for writers, called the Frederick Lewis Allen Writers\u2019 Room,\u201d the Manhattan native and Harvard graduate said. \u201cI can tell you what I have (at EKU) works better for me than what I had at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue (in New York City).\u201d To express his gratitude to the library, Flood said he agreed to serve as president of the Friends of the EKU Libraries in 2006-08. \u201cHe was the leader who spearheaded the revitalization of the group,\u201d said Carrie Cooper, dean of EKU\u2019s libraries. \u201cWe began with a handful of supporters from years past and now have nearly 200 members of our friends group thanks to Bracelen\u2019s leadership.\u201d Cooper said her staff feels privileged to assist a writer of Flood\u2019s caliber and is inspired his dedication to his work. \u201cHe is in the library many days as soon as the doors open and often doesn\u2019t leave until late into the evening,\u201d she said. \u201cHe eats lunch with our staff, celebrates their achievements, both personally and professionally, and has made many dear friends within our organization.\u201d Co-sponsored by the Friends of Madison County Public Library and Friends of the E"]

["Flood uses Lincoln portrayer to illustrate talk. When author Bracelen Flood speaks, he rarely has a Lincoln impersonator to use as a prop. However, as the author addressed a crowd of more than 220 Wednesday evening in the Grand Reading Room of Eastern Kentucky University\u2019s library, Flood called upon living history portrayer Bob Coffey to illustrate a scene depicted in his latest book, \u201c1864: Lincoln at the Gates of History.\u201d When the 12,000-man force of Confederate Gen. Jubal Early threatened the capital, coming to within five miles of the White House, Lincoln visited the capital\u2019s defenders at Fort Stevens, about five miles from the White House. Climbing upon the fort\u2019s parapet, the 6-foot, 4-inch Lincoln, wearing his trademark stovepipe hat, presented a 7-foot silhouette at which Confederate snipers could aim. To illustrate, Flood asked Coffey to stand. The Rockcastle County resident is the same height as Lincoln and almost the same age as the president was in 1864. Wearing a stovepipe hat, Coffey appeared giant-like to the audience. In contrast, the average Union soldier\u2019s height was only 5 feet, 6 inches. Lincoln probably is the only U.S. president to come under war-time fire while in office, Flood said. Captured Confederates later said their snipers recognized Lincoln\u2019s unmistakable profile, but all of their bullets missed the president who would be felled by an assassin\u2019s bullet the following year after the soldiers\u2019 guns had fallen silent. Lincoln lived long enough, however, to stiffen the nation\u2019s resolve in the face of military disasters, win re-election and see the Union to victory, Flood said. \u201cHow did Lincoln get his reputation for honesty?\u201d a questioner asked after Flood\u2019s address.

An elementary school student asked Flood what he found most interesting about Lincoln. The president set aside three hours every day for citizens to meet him in his office, Flood said. \u201cHe would see about 50 people each day in the order they arrived, regardless of who they were,\u201d the author said.

["Compromise required for transportation bill to pass. START Ohio END lawmakers voted almost completely in lockstep with their parties on a bill to provide billions of dollars for road projects, move forward with plans for passenger trains and toughen rules on drivers. Now they'll have to learn the art of the compromise. The House, controlled by Democrats, approved nearly all of Gov. Ted Strickland's two-year, $9.5 billion transportation budget, including controversial provisions green-lighting speed cameras in construction zones; a study of passenger rail service connecting Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati; stronger enforcement of seat-belt laws; and solar- and wind-energy projects on the right-of-way along the Ohio Turnpike. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, wiped out nearly all of those provisions, although the train idea held on by a thread. Democrats say cameras to nab speeders in construction zones and enforcement of the seat-belt law as a primary offense meaning drivers can be ticketed even if it's their only violation will enhance public safety. Republicans say the changes are about money and infringe on personal freedom. Democrats say the rail plan would provide a new transportation option for Ohioans and stimulate economic development. Many Republicans say the idea hasn't been adequately researched and may not find enough riders. Democrats say the state owns plenty of unused land along the turnpike that could generate green energy. Republicans say the idea was too ill-defined for them to approve. Those disputes, and dozens of smaller differences between the House and Senate bills, now go to a bipartisan, six-member conference committee to iron out the differences. The committee is tasked with developing a final bill that both chambers will either accept or reject. Though once used regularly, conference committees became a far rarer occurrence in the past decade-plus, as members of the Republican-controlled legislature grew to view the committees as a failure of compromise. But with a new Democratic-controlled House and GOP-run Senate for the first time in 16 years, the conference committee should see a resurgence. \"As a leader, you kind of want a bill to go conference committee because you have more control over it,\" said Sen. Jon Husted, a Kettering Republican who served four years as House speaker. The conference committee is scheduled to do its work today, Wednesday and Thursday if needed. It won't have time to dawdle: Strickland must sign the final compromise bill by March 31. The budget is for the 2010-11 fiscal years, which begin July 1, and the legislation doesn't take effect for 90 days. Conceivably, the conference committee could strip out the more controversial provisions such as the new driver rules and move forward on the rest of the bill. Scott Varner, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation, said it's been at least a quarter-century since the agency's budget wasn't approved by the March 31 deadline. Herb Asher, professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University, said he doesn't expect partisan wrangling to doom the transportation budget this year. \"You can't have endless stalemate,\" he said. \"Transportation is very important to the state, very important to the economy.\" There could be horse-trading on some of the items; for example, Republicans could yield on the speed cameras in exchange for Democrats dumping the seat-belt provision. But Asher said it doesn't have to be that simple. \"Conference committees have a substantial amount of power,\" he said. \"You don't have to split the difference.\" Husted said it remains unknown how the new Statehouse political dynamics will play out. House Speaker Armond Budish, D-Beachwood, is new to the process and veteran Senate President Bill M. Harris, R-Ashland, has been out of Columbus for weeks with a badly broken leg. \"What does happen will foreshadow how problems are solved with the operating budget, which is a far bigger issue,\" Husted said of that $54.4 billion two-year spending plan, which will be decided in June."]

Ted Strickland's two-year, $9.5 billion transportation budget, including controversial provisions green-lighting speed cameras in construction zones; a study of passenger rail service connecting Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati; stronger enforcement of seat-belt laws; and solar- and wind-energy projects on the right-of-way along the Ohio Turnpike. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, wiped out nearly all of those provisions, although the train idea held on by a thread. Democrats say cameras to nab speeders in construction zones and enforcement of the seat-belt law as a primary offense meaning drivers can be ticketed even if it's their only violation will enhance public safety. Republicans say the changes are about money and infringe on personal freedom. Democrats say the rail plan would provide a new transportation option for Ohioans and stimulate economic development. Many Republicans say the idea hasn't been adequately researched and may not find enough riders. Democrats say the state owns plenty of unused land along the turnpike that could generate green energy. Republicans say the idea was too ill-defined for them to approve. Those disputes, and dozens of smaller differences between the House and Senate bills, now go to a bipartisan, six-member conference committee to iron out the differences. The committee is tasked with developing a final bill that both chambers will either accept or reject. Though once used regularly, conference committees became a far rarer occurrence in the past decade-plus, as members of the Republican-controlled legislature grew to view the committees as a failure of compromise. But with a new Democratic-controlled House and GOP-run Senate for the first time in 16 years, the conference committee should see a resurgence. \"As a leader, you kind of want a bill to go conference committee because you have more control over it,\" said Sen. Jon Husted, a Kettering Republican who served four years as House speaker. The conference committee is scheduled to do its work today, Wednesday and Thursday if needed. It won't have time to dawdle: Strickland must sign the final compromise bill by March 31. The budget is for the 2010-11 fiscal years, which begin July 1, and the legislation doesn't take effect for 90 days. Conceivably, the conference committee could strip out the more controversial provisions such as the new driver rules and move forward on the rest of the bill. Scott Varner, a spokesman for the START Ohio END Department of Transportation, said it's been at least a quarter-century since the agency's budget wasn't approved by the March 31 deadline. Herb Asher, professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University, said he doesn't expect partisan wrangling to doom the transportation budget this year. \"You can't have endless stalemate,\" he said. \"Transportation is very important to the state, very important to the economy.\" There could be horse-trading on some of the items; for example, Republicans could yield on the speed cameras in exchange for Democrats dumping the seat-belt provision. But Asher said it doesn't have to be that simple. \"Conference committees have a substantial amount of power,\" he said. \"You don't have to split the difference.\" Husted said it remains unknown how the new Statehouse political dynamics will play out. House Speaker Armond Budish, D-Beachwood, is new to the process and veteran Senate President Bill M. Harris, R-Ashland, has been out of Columbus for weeks with a badly broken leg. \"What does happen will foreshadow how problems are solved with the operating budget, which is a far bigger issue,\" Husted said of that $54.4 billion two-year spending plan, which will be decided in June."]

["Tour traces L.A.'s spiritual diversity. Subtitled \"L.A.'s Unique Spiritual Legacy,\" the tour featured five venues that contributed to the spiritual traditions of the region. As the main title suggested, it was all about people seeking something beyond themselves. In addition to seeing the fellowship on Mount Washington, people who took the driving tour visited the Chapel of Jesus Ethic in Glendale, the Philosophical Research Society in Los Feliz, the Bonnie Brae House in Historic Filipinotown and one of the most recognizable religious buildings in Los Angeles: the domed Angelus Temple in Echo Park. In a printed guide to the tour, Trudi Sandmeier, director of education for the conservancy, wrote, \"As our 'City of Seekers' tour illustrates, our built environment is rich in historic religious sites, both traditional and nontraditional.\" would fall in the latter category. The organization was founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda, an Indian swami who introduced America to yoga and gained a worldwide following with his \"Autobiography of a Yogi. It's said that Yogananda had a vision of the Mount Washington site, which offers commanding views of downtown Los Angeles. As docents explained, the Mount Washington Hotel opened there in 1910 and was connected to the flatlands 940 feet below by an incline railway that was dismantled long ago. In 1925 the Mission Revival-style hotel was purchased by Yogananda, who made the site his headquarters. It remains a center for study and meditation. As one of the docents explained, pointing to parts of the complex, \"Nuns to the right; monks to the left.\" The rich and famous were among Yogananda's friends, including conductor Leopold Stokowski and famed horticulturist Luther Burbank. Which brings us to the cactus. As the story goes, Burbank talked lovingly to a cactus, so reassuring and calming that the plant dropped its needles. A cutting from the cactus was planted at the Self-Realization Fellowship and still flourishes, free of spines. Yogananda blended Eastern traditions, such as breath control, with Christianity. Indeed, visitors to the center's library could see another of his many books, \"The Yoga of Jesus,\" whose cover depicts Jesus sitting in a lotus position. To the west, across the street from the Glendale Galleria, the Chapel of Jesus Ethic offered another example of religious synthesis. The building, with a sweeping roof and lots of windows, is an example of the Modern design school popular in the 1960s. A garden is based on a garden found at Yogananda's fellowship. The complex was built as the centerpiece for the (pronounced NISH-ence), which also blends Christianity with Eastern belief systems and practices, such as meditation. Founded by Colton, who died in 1984 two months shy of her 86th birthday, the foundation also places a premium on the creative arts. The conservancy's tour booklet offered this striking anecdote: \"It was while conducting worship services in the Chapel of the Jesus Ethic on Aug. 12, 1973, that Colton experienced what is described by her followers as a levitation miracle. At this moment, as witnessed by those in the congregation, her body rose into the air and turned over, landing on her back a short distance down the aisle from her original position.

The building, a blend of vaguely classical columns and arches contrasted with art deco rectangles, looms over START Echo Park END. Inside visitors gawked at the two balconies and the 30-foot windows designed by \"Sister Aimee.\" By mid-afternoon, a rock band set up in the sanctuary and began to practice -- loudly -- for a service geared toward a young audience. The tour-takers, who were old enough to have annoyed their own parents by cranking up Rolling Stones albums, could not stand the volume for long and left the sanctuary. But, in a sense, the band was just doing what worshipers did there generations ago, though at a lower decibel level. They were seeking something as well. That's what tied Angelus Temple to the other tour venues. Like that cactus at the swami's retreat, many people are looking for a safe place to grow, a place where there's no need for spines."]
["New call for help in lynch case . START MONROE END - Federal and state law enforcement officials are nearly certain there are people living who can help them solve the 1946 Moore's Ford lynching. Top brass from the federal Department of Justice and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation made a plea Saturday in Monroe - just a few miles from the site of the country's last mass-lynching - for the public's help with one of their coldest cases. \"With a pretty good degree of certainty, almost 100 percent, there are individuals here in Walton County who can help us solve this and provide details that would fill in the blank,\" said Gregory Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta office. Jones, GBI Director Vernon Keenan and Cynthia Deitle, the FBI's civil rights unit chief, were among the panelists at a Saturday discussion and film screening on the murders in the Walton County seat. Law enforcement officials sought to show they are serious about prosecuting the murders, in which an angry white mob shot to death two black sharecroppers and their wives July 25, 1946, at the Moore's Ford bridge between Walton and Oconee counties. They also wanted to continue publicizing the case and call for anyone with information to come forward and help with the investigation. \"If we could solve the case through sheer resources, that would be done, but that is not what occurs,\" Keenan said. \"We've got to have cooperation from people who have direct knowledge or evidence about what happened. They have got to work with law enforcement for us to be able to prevail and solve this case.\" At the same time, the panelists admitted the difficulties inherent in investigating a nearly 63-year-old case and tried to tamp down expectations. \"We still have some things to do, but I certainly don't want to raise expectations,\" Jones said. However, he said, \"We're not finished, and there are a number of things that we continue to pick up on.\" No matter how gruesome the crime, the rules of evidence still apply, Keenan said. The horrific nature of the lynching of Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, and the national attention it received in the summer of 1946, caused federal officials to put an \"unprecedented amount of pressure\" on FBI agents to solve the case back then, Jones said. Two dozen federal agents swarmed the area, interviewing people and identifying 160 persons of interest. But they ran into a wall of silence from the local community and couldn't put together a case to arrest anyone. Today, the case still is a priority for the FBI and GBI, the panelists said, but they still face a problem with cooperation from people who may know something. \"It's not just a standard cold case homicide,\" said Deitle, whose office is in charge of investigating a number old civil rights era crimes. \"It's also a case where some victims' relatives, witnesses and even some perpetrators are still paralyzed by a climate of fear.\" Of the 107 cold cases the FBI currently is reviewing, the Moore's Ford lynching is the oldest and involves the most victims and alleged perpetrators, Deitle said. There have been a few breaks in the case in recent years, though none appear to have gone anywhere. Last year, FBI and GBI agents executed a search warrant at a house in Walton County's rural Gratis community. After digging in the backyard of the home, agents seized some items and sent them to the GBI's crime lab. Keenan declined to discuss the items seized or any other evidence in the case Saturday because it could inhibit the ongoing investigation. Several years ago, Keenan thought about releasing to the public the GBI's investigative file on Moore's Ford, he said following Saturday's event. He discussed it with the state attorney general, but they decided against it because there still is a chance of prosecution, he said. \"I have seen many cases that we considered to be stagnant that ... there was no activity on and then with a phone call we suddenly piece together a case and go forward with an arrest and prosecution,\" he said. \"That has happened many times in my career so I never believe that a case is hopeless. And I don't believe this one is.\" Saturday's event, sponsored by the Moore's Ford Memorial Committee, also featured a screening of filmmaker Keith Beauchamp's documentary on the killings for the TV One network."]

["New call for help in lynch case . MONROE - Federal and state law enforcement officials are nearly certain there are people living who can help them solve the 1946 Moore's Ford lynching. Top brass from the federal Department of Justice and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation made a plea Saturday in Monroe - just a few miles from the site of the country's last mass-lynching - for the public's help with one of their coldest cases. \"With a pretty good degree of certainty, almost 100 percent, there are individuals here in Walton County who can help us solve this and provide details that would fill in the blank,\" said Gregory Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta office. Jones, GBI Director Vernon Keenan and Cynthia Deitle, the FBI's civil rights unit chief, were among the panelists at a Saturday discussion and film screening on the murders in the Walton County seat. Law enforcement officials sought to show they are serious about prosecuting the murders, in which an angry white mob shot to death two black sharecroppers and their wives July 25, 1946, at the Moore's Ford bridge between START Walton END and Oconee counties. They also wanted to continue publicizing the case and call for anyone with information to come forward and help with the investigation. \"If we could solve the case through sheer resources, that would be done, but that is not what occurs,\" Keenan said. \"We've got to have cooperation from people who have direct knowledge or evidence about what happened. They have got to work with law enforcement for us to be able to prevail and solve this case.\" At the same time, the panelists admitted the difficulties inherent in investigating a nearly 63-year-old case and tried to tamp down expectations. \"We still have some things to do, but I certainly don't want to raise expectations,\" Jones said. However, he said, \"We're not finished, and there are a number of things that we continue to pick up on.\" No matter how gruesome the crime, the rules of evidence still apply, Keenan said. The horrific nature of the lynching of Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, and the national attention it received in the summer of 1946, caused federal officials to put an \"unprecedented amount of pressure\" on FBI agents to solve the case back then, Jones said. Two dozen federal agents swarmed the area, interviewing people and identifying 160 persons of interest. But they ran into a wall of silence from the local community and couldn't put together a case to arrest anyone. Today, the case still is a priority for the FBI and GBI, the panelists said, but they still face a problem with cooperation from people who may know something. \"It's not just a standard cold case homicide,\" said Deitle, whose office is in charge of investigating a number old civil rights era crimes. \"It's also a case where some victims' relatives, witnesses and even some perpetrators are still paralyzed by a climate of fear.\" Of the 107 cold cases the FBI currently is reviewing, the Moore's Ford lynching is the oldest and involves the most victims and alleged perpetrators, Deitle said. There have been a few breaks in the case in recent years, though none appear to have gone anywhere. Last year, FBI and GBI agents executed a search warrant at a house in Walton County's rural Gratis community. After digging in the backyard of the home, agents seized some items and sent them to the GBI's crime lab.

The Cypriot government says the ship breached a UN ban on Iranian arms exports. A government official from a country in the region told the AP that Ghufari's delegation \"was instructed to reach secret agreements with Cyprus\" that would allow the Syrians to receive at least part of the cargo at the Syrian port of Latakia. Two Cypriot government employees familiar with Ghufari's visit could not confirm that, saying the subject was not broached at least in formal meetings the Syrian official had with his Cypriot hosts.

["PSC official may face $24,000 in ethics fines. START Georgia END \u2019s newest utility regulator could face more than $20,000 in fines for state ethics violations stemming from a 2002 campaign. State Public Service Commissioner Lauren McDonald didn\u2019t quibble with the facts behind the ethics commission allegations, which were heard by an administratitve law judge Monday. But McDonald said he\u2019d corrected his campaign disclosures years ago, according to a transcript of his Monday remarks. He asked that the case be dismissed because of its age, and that his fine be $5,000. McDonald\u2019s violations happened during his 2002 PSC campaign. He lost to former commissioner Angela Speir, then won the seat back last fall. The ethics commission said McDonald filed one report late and filed others with missing information. He failed to properly record 80 individual contributions totaling $46,000 and 14 expenditures totaling $76,000, for instance. McDonald amended his filings to include the missing information after a complaint filed in 2004. He believed, he said, that \u201cI was given a clean bill of health\u201d then and was \u201csurprised to say the least\u201d last fall after learning the state was pursuing the issue. State ethics law changed in 2005. It allows fines of up to $1,000 per violation, which the commission defines as each piece of bad information in a disclosure. An ethics commission witness said McDonald\u2019s fines could hit $24,000, based on an internal formula that weighs the seriousness of each violation."]

The room was hushed as eyes scanned the countless screens of information the students were scouring to find out more about their own family histories. Suddenly, there was a shout of success as Blake Holdsworth, 18, and her volunteer helper, Terry Cooperrider, discovered Holdsworth's many times-great-uncle with documents from 1355. Holdsworth was told by her grandfather, who is a poet, that she is related to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a popular American poet of the 19th century, whose famous phrases include \"ships that pass in the night\" and \"the patter of little feet.\" But this discovery confirmed she is related to the poet. \"I think it's really neat,\" Holdsworth said. \"I wanted to know exactly how I was related to him.\" The project is a collaboration between Boehmer and Raynola St. Clair, of the Licking County Genealogy Society. St. Clair wants to get the word out about the importance of knowing family history and the ways to research. The daylong session was open to all students interested in learning more about their ancestors. \"It's important to know how to research on line and what resources are available,\" Boehmer said. \"I am finding a lot is available from the Licking County Public Library. The LC Genealogical Society volunteers couldn't be more helpful.\" Lindsey Evans, 17, a senior, was digging into her family history and found documentation from a ship's passenger list that an ancestor came to this country from Germany in 1852. Senior Carrie Lough, 18, was working with St. Clair and trying to locate her great-great grandfather. Her father had just told her about him, saying he had fought in World War I. It wasn't long before St. Clair could verify that Hugh Jacobson did indeed fight in the war. \"It's really interesting. I never thought about genealogy before,\" Lough said. St. Clair is on a mission to spread the word about importance of family genealogy by giving seminars in the school, churches and one-on-one.

["Valley students trace their family genealogy. BY L.B. WHYDE Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 HANOVER -- The Licking Valley students in library media specialist Tracy Boehmer's E-Research class sat around the table with laptops and a volunteer from the Licking County Genealogy Society by their side. The room was hushed as eyes scanned the countless screens of information the students were scouring to find out more about their own family histories. Suddenly, there was a shout of success as Blake Holdsworth, 18, and her volunteer helper, Terry Cooperrider, discovered Holdsworth's many times-great-uncle with documents from 1355. Holdsworth was told by her grandfather, who is a poet, that she is related to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a popular American poet of the 19th century, whose famous phrases include \"ships that pass in the night\" and \"the patter of little feet.\" But this discovery confirmed she is related to the poet. \"I think it's really neat,\" Holdsworth said. \"I wanted to know exactly how I was related to him.\" The project is a collaboration between Boehmer and Raynola St. Clair, of the Licking County Genealogy Society.

["New policy restricts some transfer students from playing high school sports. START Kanawha County END high school students will have to sit out a year of sports if they transfer from one county school to another after the start of their ninth grade year, school board members decided. At a tense and combative meeting Thursday night, the board approved the plan aimed at eliminating the recruiting of high school athletes. Board members say behavior by some coaches, boosters and parents are ruining community schools, promoting unsportsmanlike conduct and overshadowing academics. School officials are trying to correct what they said was a loophole in country policy. To get around a yearlong sports ban that applied to students who transferred from one school district to another, parents were renting apartments, moving into other family members' homes or changing custody of their children to prove they had \"moved.\" That exempted the students from the ban. After Thursday's vote, any Kanawha County student who switches high schools after the start of their ninth-grade year, for any reason, can't play sports for a year. The last chance to transfer without facing the ban is as an incoming freshman, right out of middle school. Board members signed off on the change with the caveat that they might soon consider additional restrictions, including requiring transfer students to keep a higher grade point average to play sports. The board had voted down a more stringent transfer policy earlier Thursday. That proposal would have barred any student in middle school and high school from playing sports for a year if he or she either changed schools or started as a new student in the county. It would have applied even to students who moved with their families from another county or state. Steve Hurley told the board he was recently laid off from his job at American Woodmark. He said he planned to move from Grant County to Nitro with his family to find work. \"And now, all of the sudden, the kids don't want to move because they want to play sports,\" he said. \"We're trying to move four hours to better our family and the school system says, 'No, you can't do that,'\" Hurley said. Board members Jim Crawford and Bill Raglin voted for that stricter policy. But board president Becky Jordon and board members Pete Thaw and Robin Rector voted it down. Jordon then attempted to build consensus for the compromise plan. In a 3-2 vote, the board approved the less strict policy change. Crawford and Raglin voted against it, saying it was not strong enough. Raglin specifically argued that the final policy still has too much potential for loopholes. He said students are being recruited and lured to schools to play sports and provide entertainment for fans, and then they are abandoned academically. \"I'm here to represent the concerns of the students whose parents aren't concerned,\" Raglin said. He said data given to him by Superintendent Ron Duerring show that high school athletes who transfer schools perform worse academically than other transfer students. Raglin suggested requiring a GPA of 2.5 or above for student athletes who transfer from one county school to another. The current GPA requirement is 2.0 for all student athletes. \"A 2.0 GPA guarantees one thing: consideration for a job, maybe at McDonald's,\" he said. But Kackie Eller, a guidance counselor at George Washington High School, said some of the proposed restrictions could spell \"the end of school sports as we know them.\" She said students are increasingly turning to athletic programs outside of school, especially church league basketball, to avoid confusing eligibility rules now in place. Eller raised concern that some of the proposed policy changes would punish many students because of the actions of the few. \"I don't understand why they can't just come down on the coaches,\" she said. \"The failure of this system has been our failure,\" Thaw said. \"We've allowed the overzealous coaches. We've allowed the indiscriminate boosters.\" Several board members suggested that whatever policy they adopted, they would be willing to hear appeals and grant exceptions in some cases."]

["Border guards search for missing START Latvian END climbers. Border Police are searching for three Latvian mountain climbers missing for days in the mountains of Svaneti. The Latvians, aged 25, 29 and 40, are three of a fifteen-person tourist group traveling around Svaneti. The trio broke off from the group to explore the mountain of Ushba and have not been heard from since August 4. The remaining members reported the missing climbers to a Border Police checkpoint, which immediately sent out a small search group. They began searching August 5; the next day, another twenty border guards joined the search. According to a Georgian Border Police spokesperson, a one-kilometer-wide sheet of snow fell into the valley near Ushba, a 4 700-meter-tall peak known to be one of the most treacherous and inaccessible mountains in the western part of the Caucasus mountains. \u201cPersonal belongings\u0097a camera and backpacks of the missing people were found in the snow. It is likely that the tourists got buried under the same avalanche,\u201d a spokesperson said. In 2004, two well-known Georgian climbers died on Ushba while attempting an ascent via the Mishlyaev route, considered the most challenging path to the summit. Zurab Kuchava, a prominent Georgian mountaineer, explains that there is no established search and rescue organization in the region. \u201cThere are scattered groups, but actually there is no rescue service\u0097we do it on a case-by-case basis, with individual forces. A centralized rescue team needs lots of money, and this is probably not in the interest of the people who are in charge [of the country],\u201d he said in an earlier interview.

The Latvians, aged 25, 29 and 40, are three of a fifteen-person tourist group traveling around Svaneti. The trio broke off from the group to explore the mountain of Ushba and have not been heard from since August 4. The remaining members reported the missing climbers to a Border Police checkpoint, which immediately sent out a small search group. They began searching August 5; the next day, another twenty border guards joined the search. According to a START Georgian END Border Police spokesperson, a one-kilometer-wide sheet of snow fell into the valley near Ushba, a 4 700-meter-tall peak known to be one of the most treacherous and inaccessible mountains in the western part of the Caucasus mountains. \u201cPersonal belongings\u0097a camera and backpacks of the missing people were found in the snow. It is likely that the tourists got buried under the same avalanche,\u201d a spokesperson said. In 2004, two well-known Georgian climbers died on Ushba while attempting an ascent via the Mishlyaev route, considered the most challenging path to the summit. Zurab Kuchava, a prominent Georgian mountaineer, explains that there is no established search and rescue organization in the region. \u201cThere are scattered groups, but actually there is no rescue service\u0097we do it on a case-by-case basis, with individual forces. A centralized rescue team needs lots of money, and this is probably not in the interest of the people who are in charge [of the country],\u201d he said in an earlier interview. The Border Police were tasked with the ad hoc rescue operation because the Latvians came to them to report the missing group.

["Local health care providers banding together to help poor, uninsured. In the years that area health care leaders have struggled with how to care for the uninsured -- while limiting unnecessary use of hospital emergency rooms -- the problems have only gotten worse. The 2008 economic downturn rendered many jobless, without insurance and without the extra cash for medical care. Without coverage for routine doctor visits, the uninsured often wait to seek preventive care and medical treatment until they're very sick, requiring costlier care in ERs. Others use ERs as their source for primary care but can't pay the bill. Hospitals make up that uncompensated care in other areas by charging more or eliminating some services. Here's a local snapshot. - START Springfield END hospital emergency room visits by uninsured Greene County residents grew from 17,709 visits in 2003 to 33,760 visits in 2007, the latest compiled data available. - The most common reasons for those ER visits by the uninsured were dental pain, dental/respiratory complaints, respiratory/lumbar, throat problems, alcohol/neck sprain/respiratory, and ear complaints. - The Kitchen Clinic saw 2,000 patients in 2008, or 8,000 patient visits, and turns away hundreds of people every month for lack of providers. It gave more than 47,000 free prescriptions, up from 42,000 the year before. - CoxHealth system provided $33.5 million in bad debt and charity care in fiscal year 2003, $64.3 million in 2006, and by 2007 it increased to $93.6 million. In 2008 it rose by another 13 percent, to $105.9 million. (Calculation for charity and bad debt is based on write-offs from patient charges.) The combined emergency department and urgent care visits for Cox North, South and Walnut Lawn rose from 145,000 in fiscal year 2007 to 151,000 in fiscal year 2008. The Cox ERs, alone, saw 104,000 patients in 2008. -St. John's Health System write-offs for bad debts and charity combined was $93.4 million in fiscal year 2006, $117.6 million in fiscal year 2007, and totaled $144.1 million in fiscal year 2008. (This increase is due to an increase in the number of uninsured patients and an increase in the number of insured patients who have not met the patient portion of their co-payments and deductibles.) One out of every five patients who visit the ER does not carry insurance. St. John's ER visits totaled 87,600 in fiscal year 2008, representing a 3.6 percent increase over the fiscal year 2007 ER visits of 84,500.

Others will be added from government, business and the community. In St. Louis, a financially troubled group of primary care clinics consolidated with a Jordan Valley-style community health center. The once-strapped clinics became eligible for federal funding, patients had access to more federal services like disease management, and the money saved was used to hire more health care providers, Fruend said."]

["Local health care providers banding together to help poor, uninsured. In the years that area health care leaders have struggled with how to care for the uninsured -- while limiting unnecessary use of hospital emergency rooms -- the problems have only gotten worse. The 2008 economic downturn rendered many jobless, without insurance and without the extra cash for medical care. Without coverage for routine doctor visits, the uninsured often wait to seek preventive care and medical treatment until they're very sick, requiring costlier care in ERs. Others use ERs as their source for primary care but can't pay the bill. Hospitals make up that uncompensated care in other areas by charging more or eliminating some services. Here's a local snapshot. - Springfield hospital emergency room visits by uninsured Greene County residents grew from 17,709 visits in 2003 to 33,760 visits in 2007, the latest compiled data available. - The most common reasons for those ER visits by the uninsured were dental pain, dental/respiratory complaints, respiratory/lumbar, throat problems, alcohol/neck sprain/respiratory, and ear complaints. - The Kitchen Clinic saw 2,000 patients in 2008, or 8,000 patient visits, and turns away hundreds of people every month for lack of providers. It gave more than 47,000 free prescriptions, up from 42,000 the year before. - CoxHealth system provided $33.5 million in bad debt and charity care in fiscal year 2003, $64.3 million in 2006, and by 2007 it increased to $93.6 million. In 2008 it rose by another 13 percent, to $105.9 million. (Calculation for charity and bad debt is based on write-offs from patient charges.) The combined emergency department and urgent care visits for Cox North, South and Walnut Lawn rose from 145,000 in fiscal year 2007 to 151,000 in fiscal year 2008. The Cox ERs, alone, saw 104,000 patients in 2008. -St. John's Health System write-offs for bad debts and charity combined was $93.4 million in fiscal year 2006, $117.6 million in fiscal year 2007, and totaled $144.1 million in fiscal year 2008. (This increase is due to an increase in the number of uninsured patients and an increase in the number of insured patients who have not met the patient portion of their co-payments and deductibles.) One out of every five patients who visit the ER does not carry insurance.

["Couple found dead in condo. An elderly husband and wife were found dead Monday night in their downtown START Hanover END condominium in an apparent murder-suicide, authorities said yesterday.

The bodies of Elliott Lewis, 84, and Barbara Lewis, 82, were discovered by two Hanover police officers, who responded to the complex at 85 S. Main St. after the couple's adult son grew concerned about their welfare and called the police. Yesterday, authorities released few details and said they were awaiting results of autopsies conducted by the state medical examiner's office, which should be released today. \"We have some preliminary assessments from people on scene, but it's inappropriate for me to say,\" Senior Assistant Attorney General Kirsten Wilson said during an afternoon press conference outside the Hanover police station. Authorities did say that soon after arriving at the condo Monday night, it was determined that only the Lewises were involved and that the public was not in danger. \"There are no outside forces,\" Hanover police Chief Nick Giaccone said. \"The community can rest assured that it is safe. It was fairly obvious from the beginning.\" Wilson declined to say if authorities had pinpointed who died first, a motive or a weapon, or if they had found a note at the scene. Authorities said they were interviewing the Lewises' neighbors and relatives yesterday. Giaccone said the Lewises had two adult sons and other family members scattered throughout the region and country. One of their sons, Spencer Lewis of Bethel, Vt., declined to comment yesterday when reached by phone. \"I am beside myself right now,\" said Spencer Lewis, a local singer-songwriter. Giaccone said the Hanover police had no prior contact with Elliott or Barbara Lewis. \"From the police perspective, they were not generally known to us,\" Giaccone said. The Lewises' 900-square-foot condominium is part of a 55-and-over complex adjacent to the CVS parking lot in downtown Hanover. The Lewises had lived in the building for about 10 years, Giaccone said. They were renters, according to START Hanover END Town Hall records."]

["State lawmakers say cigarette tax hike likely. START COLUMBIA END -- The sometimes-fierce nine-year battle over raising South Carolina's lowest-in-the-nation cigarette tax could end quietly this month. S.C. House Republicans and Democrats think they have a plan both sides can support to increase the tax. The plan is modeled after an Oklahoma program that uses cigarette tax revenue to secure matching federal money. That federal money then is used to provide a subsidy to buy health insurance for low-income residents or small businesses that could not afford insurance. \u201cIt looked like Oklahoma found a way to include the federal match,\u201d said House Speaker Bobby Harrell, the plan's author. \u201cThat is critical to making sure there is enough money in the fund to cover a large number of uninsured people.\u201d Last year, the House and Senate approved a 50-cent-a-pack increase. But disagreement over how the money would be spent meant the House could not override Gov. Mark Sanford's veto. If approved by the federal government, the House plan would raise the state cigarette tax by 50 cents a pack, raising about $147 million. That money, matched about 2-for-1 with federal Medicaid money, would provide tax credits to employers worth about 75 percent of the cost of buying health insurance for their employees. \"This is a compromise between people who want something tax-neutral and those folks who want to expand Medicaid,\" Harrell said. Additionally, about $5 million a year would pay for efforts to help people quit smoking. The state currently provides no money to help pay for smoking-cessation efforts."]

Announcing the result at the county supervisors\u2019 meeting this morning, County Engineer Bill Belzer said the final award would be about $35,900, plus an unknown amount of interest. It was a considerably smaller amount than the county had hoped for. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get less than $50,000,\u201d Belzer said, \u201cconsidering the fact that START Washington County END had a smaller bridge that they got more money for.\u201d"]

["START Russian END artists in America. Generations of Russian artists who emigrated to the U.S. are on display at the Russian Museum. David Burliuk\u2019s \u2018Portrait of Professor Nicholas K. Roerich\u2019 (1929) is one of the items displayed. In David Burliuk\u2019s \u201cHudson,\u201d a view of the New York City skyline seems to fly apart into ribbons of image and memory like a fleeting dream. But for Burliuk and the other Russian emigre artists featured in a new exhibition at the Russian Museum, America was a tangible reality that strongly influenced the development of their art, as demonstrated by Burliuk\u2019s departure from his earlier work in \u201cHudson.\u201d The traveling exhibition, titled \u201cAmerican Artists from the Russian Empire,\u201d includes 45 artists who left Russia or the Soviet Union for America in the first half of the 20th century, and is the first time such a cast of artists has been assembled. \u201cSome go together, some don\u2019t,\u201d said Yevgenia Petrova, deputy director of the State Russian Museum and the project\u2019s main creative force. \u201cIt\u2019s a cross-section of what went on in Russian-American art up to the middle of the 20th century.\u201d This schizophrenic amalgam of paintings and sculptures runs the gamut from Neo-classicism to Abstract art and includes several generations of artists, from Cubo-futurist Max Weber to Alexander Liberman. The idea came from a 2003 exhibition of Russians who emigrated to France. The American-based Foundation for International Arts and Education organized the exhibition, drawing from museums, galleries and private collections in the U.S. The show made its debut at the Fred Jones Jr. Museum at the University of Oklahoma this spring, and will return to San Diego after a two-month run at Moscow\u2019s Tretyakov Gallery this summer. Its appearance in St. Petersburg marks the first time these works have been shown in Russia. \u201cFor the American public, the goal is to remind viewers that these artists had Russian roots, to point out what they brought from Russia to American art, and what from American art influenced them,\u201d Petrova said. In Russia, the exhibition aims to familiarize viewers with new art. \u201cFor [these artists], showing in Russia was impossible because of the Iron Curtain; it wasn\u2019t patriotic to show such work,\u201d Petrova said. American visitors will likely know artists like Mark Rothko, whose distinctive abstract style featuring solid blocks of color has become an icon of American art. Russian art-lovers, on the other hand, may know Boris Grigoryev, whose striking, slightly off-kilter portraits and depictions of peasant life have been extensively exhibited in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. The first wave of Russian artists to move to America was mainly made up of Jews who left before the Bolshevik Revolution, seeking chances to exhibit and study art after suffering anti-Semitism in Russia. \u201cThey left to obtain an education and gain freedom,\u201d Petrova said. Life in the Jewish Pale denied these artists a chance to show their work or communicate with kindred spirits on the international art scene, she explained. After the revolution, many more artists fled in the face of violence, starvation and political persecution during the Civil War and under the Soviet regime. \u201cThey left \u2026 to avoid prison and stay alive, but also to keep working; they didn\u2019t want to take part in Socialist realism,\u201d Petrova said. Once in the United States, Russian artists were exposed to fluid, \u201ccontagious\u201d new influences that profoundly affected their work, Petrova said. \u201cThe Burliuk painting of New York is so unexpected for Burliuk, it shows how strongly American art influenced these artists,\u201d she said. At the same time, the Russian artists influenced their American counterparts and retained something distinctly Russian in their work. Petrova pointed to surrealist painter Pavel Tchelitchew, who is included in the exhibition, and how his overarching aesthetic resembled that of Pavel Filonov, who remained in Russia. Although the two men most likely didn\u2019t know each other\u2019s work, they arrived at similar ideas on \u201cwhat\u2019s close to man in nature\u201d thanks to a shared background in Russian natural philosophy, she said.

American visitors will likely know artists like Mark Rothko, whose distinctive abstract style featuring solid blocks of color has become an icon of American art. Russian art-lovers, on the other hand, may know Boris Grigoryev, whose striking, slightly off-kilter portraits and depictions of peasant life have been extensively exhibited in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. The first wave of Russian artists to move to America was mainly made up of Jews who left before the Bolshevik Revolution, seeking chances to exhibit and study art after suffering anti-Semitism in Russia. \u201cThey left to obtain an education and gain freedom,\u201d Petrova said. Life in the Jewish Pale denied these artists a chance to show their work or communicate with kindred spirits on the international art scene, she explained.

["Mum denies making up child death story in deportation battle. START Nigerian END woman Pamela Izevbekhai yesterday insisted she had not fabricated a story about the death of her baby daughter in order to be allowed to remain in Ireland. Ms Izevbekhai \"totally rejected\" allegations that she manufactured the story to bolster her case against deportation. \"I did have a daughter Elizabeth and she did die as I said,\" said the Sligo-based mother who has been fighting a long-running legal battle against deportation. She has consistently maintained that her first daughter died at the age of 17 months after being subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) and has argued that if the family is sent back to Nigeria her two younger daughters would be subjected to the same procedure. The mayor of Sligo, Veronica Cawley, yesterday stood by her decision to hold a civic reception for Ms Izevbekhai last year while a spokesman for the Sligo-based Let Them Stay organisation said yesterday's reports raised more questions than they answered. Cllr Cawley said some people had suggested that she should apologise for holding the civic reception but she insisted: \"I have nothing to apologise for.\" At that function in Sligo Town Hall, Pamela wept as she said that Elizabeth would always be with the family and was a guardian angel for her sisters Naomi and Jemima. Cllr Cawley urged people not to jump to conclusions until all the facts come out. \"I have always said that the purpose of the civic reception was to highlight the barbaric practice of female genital mutilation and today I repeat my call for a worldwide ban on this torture,\" said Cllr Cawley. \"Before Pamela came to live in the north west, most us had never heard of FGM but there is a huge awareness now.'' \"These reports are only a snap shot in a long-running investigation which is not over yet,\" said Cllr Cawley. Cllr Cawley said that while a number of people had gone on local radio yesterday saying she should apologise for holding a civic reception for Ms Izevbekhai \"everyone who phoned me today was supportive\". Supporters of Ms Izevbekhai pointed out that while Lagos-based obstetrician Dr Joseph Unokanjo was now claiming that he had never delivered a baby called Elizabeth Izevbekhai, and that he had never treated her for post-FGM blood loss, a doctor of the same name has in the past given interviews to RTE and Ocean FM in Sligo saying the opposite and supporting Pamela's account. They also pointed out that he is now saying that the baby he delivered for Pamela in 2000 was her first baby but she has a teenage son Adrian who lives with his father Tony in Nigeria. A spokesman for Let Them Stay questioned why this material had been leaked now and whether there was an agenda behind it. \"The safety of these two little girls should still be the main issue and I wonder is the Irish government saying that it is safe to send them back to Nigeria?\" he said. \"We would like to see Dr Unokanjo come on Irish radio again and see what he has to say now.\" He said supporters were concerned about why these claims were being made now, four years after Ms Izevbekhai first outlined her fears."]

Cllr Cawley urged people not to jump to conclusions until all the facts come out. \"I have always said that the purpose of the civic reception was to highlight the barbaric practice of female genital mutilation and today I repeat my call for a worldwide ban on this torture,\" said Cllr Cawley. \"Before Pamela came to live in the north west, most us had never heard of FGM but there is a huge awareness now.'' \"These reports are only a snap shot in a long-running investigation which is not over yet,\" said Cllr Cawley. Cllr Cawley said that while a number of people had gone on local radio yesterday saying she should apologise for holding a civic reception for Ms Izevbekhai \"everyone who phoned me today was supportive\". Supporters of Ms Izevbekhai pointed out that while Lagos-based obstetrician Dr Joseph Unokanjo was now claiming that he had never delivered a baby called Elizabeth Izevbekhai, and that he had never treated her for post-FGM blood loss, a doctor of the same name has in the past given interviews to RTE and Ocean FM in Sligo saying the opposite and supporting Pamela's account. They also pointed out that he is now saying that the baby he delivered for Pamela in 2000 was her first baby but she has a teenage son Adrian who lives with his father Tony in Nigeria. A spokesman for Let Them Stay questioned why this material had been leaked now and whether there was an agenda behind it. \"The safety of these two little girls should still be the main issue and I wonder is the START Irish END government saying that it is safe to send them back to Nigeria?\" he said. \"We would like to see Dr Unokanjo come on Irish radio again and see what he has to say now.\" He said supporters were concerned about why these claims were being made now, four years after Ms Izevbekhai first outlined her fears."]
["Mum denies making up child death story in deportation battle. Nigerian woman Pamela Izevbekhai yesterday insisted she had not fabricated a story about the death of her baby daughter in order to be allowed to remain in Ireland. Ms Izevbekhai \"totally rejected\" allegations that she manufactured the story to bolster her case against deportation. \"I did have a daughter Elizabeth and she did die as I said,\" said the Sligo-based mother who has been fighting a long-running legal battle against deportation.

[" START Pakistan END to restore chief justice ousted by Musharraf. ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistan agreed Monday to reinstate a fired chief justice, a move that will help defuse a political crisis that has sparked street battles and raised fears of instability in the country at a time of surging Islamist violence. Opposition leaders and lawyers had vowed to sit-in at the parliament later Monday until Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, known for his independence and willingness to challenge authority, was reinstated. The capital has been barricaded and scores of extra police brought in amid fears of violence. In a dawn address to the nation that capped a night of high drama, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani announced Chaudhry would be sworn in on March 21, the day the current chief justice was due to retire. The speech triggered scenes of jubilation outside Chaudhry's home in the capital, Islamabad. Gilani also ordered all lawyers and political activists arrested over the past week to be freed immediately. The concession came as thousands of protesters led by Nawaz Sharif, the head of the largest opposition party and a longtime foe of President Asif Ali Zardari, were traveling to Islamabad to join the planned sit-in. Sharif joined the convoy after ignoring a house arrest order in his hometown of Lahore in Punjab, where his supporters fought running battles with police. \"This is a victory for the people of this country,\" said Baz Mohammad Kakar, a leader of the lawyers' movement. \"Chaudhry is the first chief justice in the history of Pakistan who has proved himself to be a judge for the people, as a chief justice for the people.\" Former President Pervez Musharraf fired Chaudhry, 60, in 2007 after he took up cases challenging the leader's rule, sparking a wave of protests that helped force Musharraf from power in 2008. Musharraf's successor, Zardari, pledged to reinstate Chaudhry within 30 days of taking office, but reneged on the promise, apparently fearing the justice might examine a deal that he and his wife, slain politician Benazir Bhutto, struck with Musharraf to grant the pair immunity from prosecution over alleged corruption cases. Lawyers and civil rights activists have remained committed to the cause of Chaudhry's reinstatement, believing it was a vital first step in getting an independent judiciary in Pakistan."]

["Pakistan to restore chief justice ousted by Musharraf. ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistan agreed Monday to reinstate a fired chief justice, a move that will help defuse a political crisis that has sparked street battles and raised fears of instability in the country at a time of surging Islamist violence. Opposition leaders and lawyers had vowed to sit-in at the parliament later Monday until Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, known for his independence and willingness to challenge authority, was reinstated. The capital has been barricaded and scores of extra police brought in amid fears of violence. In a dawn address to the nation that capped a night of high drama, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani announced Chaudhry would be sworn in on March 21, the day the current chief justice was due to retire. The speech triggered scenes of jubilation outside Chaudhry's home in the capital, Islamabad. Gilani also ordered all lawyers and political activists arrested over the past week to be freed immediately. The concession came as thousands of protesters led by Nawaz Sharif, the head of the largest opposition party and a longtime foe of President Asif Ali Zardari, were traveling to Islamabad to join the planned sit-in. Sharif joined the convoy after ignoring a house arrest order in his hometown of Lahore in Punjab, where his supporters fought running battles with police. \"This is a victory for the people of this country,\" said Baz Mohammad Kakar, a leader of the lawyers' movement. \"Chaudhry is the first chief justice in the history of START Pakistan END who has proved himself to be a judge for the people, as a chief justice for the people.\" Former President Pervez Musharraf fired Chaudhry, 60, in 2007 after he took up cases challenging the leader's rule, sparking a wave of protests that helped force Musharraf from power in 2008.

[" START South Charleston END to get carbon capture pilot plant. The Dow Chemical Co. announced that French engineering company Alstom will build a pilot plant to capture carbon dioxide from the flue gas at Dow's coal-fired power plant in South Charleston. The companies said Alstom will design, construct and operate the pilot plant and Dow will provide the site, the utilities and the chemicals. The plant will use amine technology jointly developed by Alstom and Dow. Amines are organic compounds. Gov. Joe Manchin said, \"We're tickled to death they're coming here. This is research that we think has an awful lot of promise. If we could retrofit coal-fired plants, what a break that is. \"It seems that chemists have found things that can drop carbon out of the stack. We think this could be the key that unlocks the future of how we'll be able to deal with the carbon that's coming off of existing coal-fired power plants.\" Jim Guidarini, Dow's West Virginia site leader, said the South Charleston power plant has the only coal-fired boiler owned by Dow Chemical in the United States. The power plant has three boilers -- two that burn natural gas and one that burns coal. The pilot plant will test the Alstom-Dow amine carbon capture process on the coal-fired boiler's flue gas. Work on the pad for the pilot plant began several weeks ago, Guidarini said. About 20 construction workers will be on site at the height of construction. \"We expect construction to be done in another couple of months,\" he said. The plant is expected to begin operating by the third quarter of this year. Alstom then will have five people on site to operate it. \"We expect it to run for two years,\" Guidarini said. \"It depends on what we learn. That's why we're doing a pilot -- to learn things.\" Asked about the plant's price tag, Guidarini said, \"We're not releasing any cost information on it.\" \"The way the amine process works is, you scrub the carbon dioxide out of the vent stream with the amines,\" Guidarini said. \"You have a reactive product. Then you get the carbon dioxide off and you have pure carbon dioxide. The idea going forward in large plants is, you sequester the carbon dioxide somehow. In this plant we're just testing the first piece -- how do you capture the carbon dioxide, how do you get it off the amines?\" The carbon dioxide that is captured will be released, he said. \"The problem with carbon dioxide is, it's tough to use,\" said. \"It's not very reactive. It's a hard feedstock to do anything with. You don't hear of anybody doing anything with carbon dioxide because it's tough to do. But that's something Dow in the future is certainly looking at.\" Manchin said, \"The money will be in the research to figure out what you do with the carbon. It's like when we burned coal and had refuse piles. Then they captured sulfur with a limestone spray and had another byproduct. Now they're using that byproduct to make gypsum board. There's got to be a way to solidify carbon and use it for fuel.\" The cost of removing carbon dioxide is considered an energy loss, since the energy needed for the process is subtracted from that generated by a power plant. Guidarini said Dow believes its proprietary amines technology is much less energy intensive than other processes. The pilot plant will capture about 1,800 tons of carbon dioxide a year. This is the second carbon capture project to be announced in West Virginia. The other project is much larger. Alstom, American Electric Power and German utility conglomerate RWE are building it at American Electric's Mountaineer power plant in Mason County. American Electric is investing about $76 million in the Mason County project, which is designed to capture about 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Alstom has said that research shows its technology may only cause an energy loss of 10 percent. In addition to capturing carbon dioxide, the Mason County project will chill it to a liquid using Alstom's Chilled Ammonia Process. The liquid will be permanently stored underground. American Electric is working with subcontractor Battelle Memorial Institute on the storage system. The Mason County project is expected to begin operating in September."]

In this plant we're just testing the first piece -- how do you capture the carbon dioxide, how do you get it off the amines?\" The carbon dioxide that is captured will be released, he said. \"The problem with carbon dioxide is, it's tough to use,\" said. \"It's not very reactive. It's a hard feedstock to do anything with. You don't hear of anybody doing anything with carbon dioxide because it's tough to do. But that's something Dow in the future is certainly looking at.\" Manchin said, \"The money will be in the research to figure out what you do with the carbon. It's like when we burned coal and had refuse piles. Then they captured sulfur with a limestone spray and had another byproduct. Now they're using that byproduct to make gypsum board. There's got to be a way to solidify carbon and use it for fuel.\" The cost of removing carbon dioxide is considered an energy loss, since the energy needed for the process is subtracted from that generated by a power plant. Guidarini said Dow believes its proprietary amines technology is much less energy intensive than other processes. The pilot plant will capture about 1,800 tons of carbon dioxide a year. This is the second carbon capture project to be announced in West Virginia. The other project is much larger. Alstom, American Electric Power and German utility conglomerate RWE are building it at American Electric's Mountaineer power plant in Mason County. American Electric is investing about $76 million in the Mason County project, which is designed to capture about 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Alstom has said that research shows its technology may only cause an energy loss of 10 percent. In addition to capturing carbon dioxide, the Mason County project will chill it to a liquid using Alstom's Chilled Ammonia Process. The liquid will be permanently stored underground. American Electric is working with subcontractor Battelle Memorial Institute on the storage system. The Mason County project is expected to begin operating in September."]
["South Charleston to get carbon capture pilot plant. The Dow Chemical Co. announced that French engineering company Alstom will build a pilot plant to capture carbon dioxide from the flue gas at Dow's coal-fired power plant in South Charleston. The companies said Alstom will design, construct and operate the pilot plant and Dow will provide the site, the utilities and the chemicals. The plant will use amine technology jointly developed by Alstom and Dow. Amines are organic compounds. Gov. Joe Manchin said, \"We're tickled to death they're coming here. This is research that we think has an awful lot of promise. If we could retrofit coal-fired plants, what a break that is. \"It seems that chemists have found things that can drop carbon out of the stack. We think this could be the key that unlocks the future of how we'll be able to deal with the carbon that's coming off of existing coal-fired power plants.\" Jim Guidarini, Dow's West Virginia site leader, said the South Charleston power plant has the only coal-fired boiler owned by Dow Chemical in the United States. The power plant has three boilers -- two that burn natural gas and one that burns coal. The pilot plant will test the Alstom-Dow amine carbon capture process on the coal-fired boiler's flue gas. Work on the pad for the pilot plant began several weeks ago, Guidarini said. About 20 construction workers will be on site at the height of construction. \"We expect construction to be done in another couple of months,\" he said. The plant is expected to begin operating by the third quarter of this year. Alstom then will have five people on site to operate it. \"We expect it to run for two years,\" Guidarini said. \"It depends on what we learn.

["South Charleston to get carbon capture pilot plant. The Dow Chemical Co. announced that French engineering company Alstom will build a pilot plant to capture carbon dioxide from the flue gas at Dow's coal-fired power plant in South Charleston. The companies said Alstom will design, construct and operate the pilot plant and Dow will provide the site, the utilities and the chemicals. The plant will use amine technology jointly developed by Alstom and Dow. Amines are organic compounds. Gov. Joe Manchin said, \"We're tickled to death they're coming here. This is research that we think has an awful lot of promise. If we could retrofit coal-fired plants, what a break that is. \"It seems that chemists have found things that can drop carbon out of the stack. We think this could be the key that unlocks the future of how we'll be able to deal with the carbon that's coming off of existing coal-fired power plants.\" Jim Guidarini, Dow's West Virginia site leader, said the South Charleston power plant has the only coal-fired boiler owned by Dow Chemical in the United States. The power plant has three boilers -- two that burn natural gas and one that burns coal. The pilot plant will test the Alstom-Dow amine carbon capture process on the coal-fired boiler's flue gas. Work on the pad for the pilot plant began several weeks ago, Guidarini said. About 20 construction workers will be on site at the height of construction. \"We expect construction to be done in another couple of months,\" he said. The plant is expected to begin operating by the third quarter of this year. Alstom then will have five people on site to operate it. \"We expect it to run for two years,\" Guidarini said. \"It depends on what we learn. That's why we're doing a pilot -- to learn things.\" Asked about the plant's price tag, Guidarini said, \"We're not releasing any cost information on it.\" \"The way the amine process works is, you scrub the carbon dioxide out of the vent stream with the amines,\" Guidarini said. \"You have a reactive product. Then you get the carbon dioxide off and you have pure carbon dioxide. The idea going forward in large plants is, you sequester the carbon dioxide somehow. In this plant we're just testing the first piece -- how do you capture the carbon dioxide, how do you get it off the amines?\" The carbon dioxide that is captured will be released, he said. \"The problem with carbon dioxide is, it's tough to use,\" said. \"It's not very reactive. It's a hard feedstock to do anything with. You don't hear of anybody doing anything with carbon dioxide because it's tough to do. But that's something Dow in the future is certainly looking at.\" Manchin said, \"The money will be in the research to figure out what you do with the carbon. It's like when we burned coal and had refuse piles. Then they captured sulfur with a limestone spray and had another byproduct. Now they're using that byproduct to make gypsum board. There's got to be a way to solidify carbon and use it for fuel.\" The cost of removing carbon dioxide is considered an energy loss, since the energy needed for the process is subtracted from that generated by a power plant. Guidarini said Dow believes its proprietary amines technology is much less energy intensive than other processes. The pilot plant will capture about 1,800 tons of carbon dioxide a year. This is the second carbon capture project to be announced in West Virginia. The other project is much larger. Alstom, American Electric Power and German utility conglomerate RWE are building it at American Electric's Mountaineer power plant in Mason County.

["Okruashvili: Saakashvili Greater Threat than START Russia END .

Okruashvili, whose party Movement for United Georgia is part of group of another dozen of opposition parties planning to launch street protest rallies from April 9 to demand the President\u2019s resignation, said in a televised interview that he personally had no presidential ambitions. The interview, which was recorded in Paris on March 24, was aired by late on March 27 by the Tbilisi-based Maestro TV, which covers mainly the capital city. Okruashvili, who has received political asylum in France, was sentenced to 11-year prison term in Georgia in absentia last year. \u201cAfter [the August] war politicians should give up manipulating with the issue of restoration of the territorial integrity, especially during the election campaign, because that is an issue, which will be impossible to resolve in next ten or fifteen years in the best case, if not in the next twenty or twenty five years,\u201d he said. Okruashvili said that after the August \u201cmilitary adventure\u201d Saakashvili had \u201cno legitimate right to stay in power.\u201d \u201cI know that the remarks, which I will say now will trigger lots of sharp comments, but I have to say it anyway \u2013 this is the case when removal of Saakashvili from power is justifiable with any humanely method. He is today the number one threat for the country and the greater threat than Russia,\u201d Okruashvili said. He said he did not believe that Russia was interested in removal of Georgia\u2019s current leadership and said such rhetoric was part of the authorities\u2019 \u201cpropaganda.\u201d \u201cA weak figure [in the Georgian leadership] like Saakashvili is more acceptable for Russia,\u201d Okruashvili said. \u201cSaakashvili, who has almost no western support and no one in the west is even saying hello to him, is more acceptable for Russia.

["Council looks over \u2018to do\u2019 list.

He cited airport development, wastewater treatment and water delivery as \u201csome big infrastructure I think we do need to have a general plan about where we are going.\u201d Freelen agreed that long-term planning in those areas would give future councils some type of guidelines as well as serve as a measurement tool to show \u201cwhere we have been and where we are going.\u201d Although Brown said he would have liked to have the bullet list presented Monday \u201c18 months ago,\u201d the councilman added, \u201cFrom this you look at it and then you make your strategic plan.

[" START West Columbia END City Council calls special meeting . Mayor Bobby E. Horton called the Special Council Meeting of the West Columbia Council to order on Monday, March 16, 2009 at 6 pm. All members were present: Mayor Bobby E. Horton, Mayor Pro- Tem Tommy G. Parler, Eric L. Fowler, L. Dale Harley, Jack L. Harmon, Boyd J. Jones, Marsha J. Moore, Cathy Shannon and B.J. Unthank. John Banks, director of tourism with the West Metro Chamber of Commerce spoke on the various ways the chamber is promoting the area. Among other points, Banks said that special emphasis would be given to improving West Metro's brochures and encouraging business travelers to stay in West Columbia hotels. Additionally, Banks told council that the chamber was working to redesign its ads at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport. Banks said that a frequent complaint from visitors was that the ads at the airport were difficult to read. Banks added that the chamber would be promoting the West Columbia area's whitewater rafting opportunities. He reminded council that visitors can go whitewater rafting in the morning and see a play in Columbia that evening. Councilman Harley said he was particularly impressed with this idea. Banks also announced that the chamber was completely redesigning its website. Banks said that Splash Omnimedia of Lexington, South Carolina has been hired for the job. Mayor Horton said the city of West Columbia had received a grant from the state to assist in domestic violence evidence collection. The mayor reminded council members of their upcoming budget meetings. First reading unanimous approval was given to an ordinance that would move West Columbia city elections to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in odd- numbered years. Currently, the city holds elections on the first Tuesday in September on those years. Mayor Horton pointed out the reason for the ordinance was to align the city with other municipalities in Lexington County and to encourage voter turnout, as most voters are used to casting their ballots in November. Unanimous approval was given to a resolution authorizing the mayor to award contracts to the lowest responsive, responsible bidders to improve the city's water and sewer system contingent upon authorization by SRF Authority. Tom Bowlers with AECOM addressed council briefly on the matter and responding to a question from Councilman Fowler said the work on the city's water and sewer system would likely begin in about 30 to 45 days, once the credentials and qualifications of the subcontractors have been examined and additional documents had been received. Unanimous approval was given to a resolution authorizing the consumption of beer and wine in cups at the Riverwalk Music Festival and the Rhythm on the River Concert Series at the Riverwalk Amphitheatre. Mayor Horton strongly emphasized that beer and wine consumption would only be allowed at the Riverwalk Amphitheatre during those specific events."]

Purdin, 71, drove the START Springfield END City Area Transit Villa Road route for the last time on Thursday, March 26, joined by his family. He will retire effective today, march 31, after 35 years working for the Springfield Bus Co. In his time, Purdin has seen a lot of changes. The first buses he drove lacked wheelchair lifts, window defrosters and air conditioners. In summer, drivers kept the doors open to stay cool. He enjoyed his relationship with the riders and his colleagues. \"I got to talk to people every day and I like people,\" he said. \"Throughout the years, I met all kinds of people.\" Purdin once drove presidential candidate and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole around Ohio when he chartered a bus. \"Every time we stopped the bus, you had guys standing there from D.C. and they had these big guns,\" Purdin said. Rhonda Moore has worked with Purdin for 18 years. She didn't know if she would like him. On her first day driving alone, he yelled at her for a bad parking job. \"But he's a big softy, he's been fun,\" she said. \"He's like a big kid.\" Purdin likes to go all out and dress up for holidays, said Michelle Taber, SCAT operations manager. \"He was always on time, always here and always had a smile on his face,\" she said.

["Economy affecting high school, college students. Janet Johnson, a guidance counselor at START Norfolk END High School, works with Brenda Mercado, a junior at Norfolk High, on some college and career options. Johnson said she\u2019s aware of a number of high school students who are having to work part time while going to high school in order to help support their families during this challenging economic times. Thinking of taking a year or two off after high school to work before starting college? If so, Janet Johnson, a guidance counselor at Norfolk High School, has some advice to offer. First, it's important for students to check what will happen to their health insurance if they hope to stay on their parents' coverage but do not attend school full time. That can be a big consideration for some young people. \"The other thing that I encourage them to do is if they're going to work full time is to really stop and plan how they're going to budget their money so that they don't get used to having all of that income,\" Johnson said. \"If they return to school and have fewer hours and their expenses have expanded to their whole paycheck, that can be really difficult. \"Johnson said it's important for these young people to make a budget so they know how much they can afford to spend and save each month so they do not become over-obligated financially. A period of full-time work can sometimes be an encouragement to certain young people who have postponed college, she said. \"Sometimes that year or two off working full time or working at a job that maybe really isn't their favorite thing to do can be kind of motivating,\" Johnson said. \"Going to college becomes an incentive to getting a job that a (young person) wants more then the job they're currently doing. \"Johnson said taking time off between high school and college can be a challenge for some students academically. Study habits, formulas in math and concepts in science and English may be forgotten over time, but Johnson said colleges provide tutoring and resource centers for students who need extra help."]

["Scandal-plagued START Ga. END pastor to be buried Saturday. ATLANTA - A former mega church leader who rose to fame with his progressive evangelical ministry only to have it crumble after a series of sex scandals will be honored in the church he helped build in suburban Atlanta. Archbishop Earl Paulk of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit at Chapel Hill Harvester Church died Sunday after a battle with cancer. He was 81. A funeral is scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday at the Cathedral in Decatur. For years the church was at the forefront of many social movements - admitting black members in the 1960s, ordaining women and opening its doors to gays. But Paulk was dogged for decades by accusations of molestation and sexual misconduct. The most shocking revelation came in October 2007 when a court-ordered paternity test showed he was the biological father of his brother's son, D.E. Paulk, who had become head pastor of the church after the archbishop retired the previous year. Earl Paulk had sworn in an affidavit he'd never had sex with anyone but his wife, which lead to him pleading guilty to a felony charge of lying under oath. He was sentenced to 10 years' probation and a $1,000 fine. None of the Paulks could be reached for comment by The Associated Press, but D.E. Paulk issued a statement. \"Over the past 55 years, Bishop Paulk has ministered to thousands in the Atlanta area and touched the lives of countless thousands in the global community,\" he wrote. \"As the family and church mourn his death and celebrate his life, we pray for peace and closure for all who have been connected in any way to his life and ministry.\" Paulk's church, which he co-founded with his brother, Don, grew from a tiny congregation in the 1960s to a massive empire with 10,000 members, an international television ministry, a Bible college and a $12 million sanctuary on an expansive 100-acre plot in Decatur. Paulk was invited to a White House prayer breakfast by then-President Ronald Reagan, and the church was named one of former President George Bush's \"1,000 Points of Light.\" The church made national headlines in 1992 when six female members came forward saying they were brainwashed into having sexual relationships with Earl Paulk and Don Paulk and other ministers at the church. A decade later, a former church member accused Earl Paulk of molesting her when she was a child and teenager, a lawsuit that eventually was settled out of court. Then former church employee Mona Brewer sued Earl Paulk and the church, saying she had been coerced into having a long-term affair with the pastor because he told her it was her godly duty. It was her lawsuit that led to the paternity test and the felony charge. At the same time, Earl Paulk was battling prostate cancer and undergoing multiple surgeries that left him weak and unable to make much more than one appearance at the church each week. The church's membership dwindled to 1,000 - mostly due to the sexual scandals - and the flashy neo-Gothic cathedral is up for sale for $24.5 million. The church is seeking to move to a smaller venue and continue its ministry, D.E. Paulk has said. Don Paulk told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he hopes his brother will be remembered for his work in ministry rather than the scandals. \"Preachers are just like anyone else - they're a man,\" he told the newspaper."]

Archbishop Earl Paulk of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit at Chapel Hill Harvester Church died Sunday after a battle with cancer. He was 81. A funeral is scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday at the Cathedral in START Decatur END . For years the church was at the forefront of many social movements - admitting black members in the 1960s, ordaining women and opening its doors to gays. But Paulk was dogged for decades by accusations of molestation and sexual misconduct. The most shocking revelation came in October 2007 when a court-ordered paternity test showed he was the biological father of his brother's son, D.E. Paulk, who had become head pastor of the church after the archbishop retired the previous year. Earl Paulk had sworn in an affidavit he'd never had sex with anyone but his wife, which lead to him pleading guilty to a felony charge of lying under oath. He was sentenced to 10 years' probation and a $1,000 fine. None of the Paulks could be reached for comment by The Associated Press, but D.E. Paulk issued a statement. \"Over the past 55 years, Bishop Paulk has ministered to thousands in the Atlanta area and touched the lives of countless thousands in the global community,\" he wrote. \"As the family and church mourn his death and celebrate his life, we pray for peace and closure for all who have been connected in any way to his life and ministry.\" Paulk's church, which he co-founded with his brother, Don, grew from a tiny congregation in the 1960s to a massive empire with 10,000 members, an international television ministry, a Bible college and a $12 million sanctuary on an expansive 100-acre plot in Decatur. Paulk was invited to a White House prayer breakfast by then-President Ronald Reagan, and the church was named one of former President George Bush's \"1,000 Points of Light.\" The church made national headlines in 1992 when six female members came forward saying they were brainwashed into having sexual relationships with Earl Paulk and Don Paulk and other ministers at the church. A decade later, a former church member accused Earl Paulk of molesting her when she was a child and teenager, a lawsuit that eventually was settled out of court. Then former church employee Mona Brewer sued Earl Paulk and the church, saying she had been coerced into having a long-term affair with the pastor because he told her it was her godly duty. It was her lawsuit that led to the paternity test and the felony charge. At the same time, Earl Paulk was battling prostate cancer and undergoing multiple surgeries that left him weak and unable to make much more than one appearance at the church each week. The church's membership dwindled to 1,000 - mostly due to the sexual scandals - and the flashy neo-Gothic cathedral is up for sale for $24.5 million. The church is seeking to move to a smaller venue and continue its ministry, D.E. Paulk has said. Don Paulk told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he hopes his brother will be remembered for his work in ministry rather than the scandals. \"Preachers are just like anyone else - they're a man,\" he told the newspaper."]

["Education minister would like to see boards share vacant spaces. START Ontario END 's education minister said Friday she's ready to write regulations compelling school boards to share vacant space with other school boards and community partners. Kathleen Wynne said she would look to write these regulations as a response to recommendations from a report she commissioned on declining enrolment within the province's schools. \"Closing or consolidating schools is one response to declining enrolment -- in some circumstances, the appropriate response,\" the report states. \"However, many circumstances exist in which school closures are undesirable or even unworkable.\" Several of the report's recommendations focus on encouraging and even mandating school boards to seek out partnerships that would allow vacant space in schools to be used rather than remain empty and become a financial burden. \"The (recommendations) that co-terminous boards be required to share or consider shared facilities -- I was looking for that kind of recommendation if the group deemed it appropriate and they have come through with that,\" Wynne said in a Friday phone interview from her constituency office in Toronto. She said she was also encouraged by the recommendation school boards be required to solicit interest from potential community partners for excess space in their schools. \"We're not just going to encourage this, but write regulations to say this is what should happen,\" Wynne said. \"It's a matter of figuring out how to do it and the language of the regulations.\" She was also encouraged by a related recommendation the province look to use empty space in schools to provide its services before building or leasing space elsewhere. She said it would require action beyond her own ministry, but reinforced the concept of community hubs where Ontarians can access as many services as possible. The report was released by Wynne Friday, and contains 21 recommendations for the Ontario government to help school boards and communities understand and deal with the impact of fewer school-aged children in the province. The group recommends the province and all school boards do a better job of explaining what declining enrolment is and how it affects a school's ability to teach students the skills they need to be successful. It wants the province to mandate a single template for reporting changes in enrolment, and that school boards be required to start considering options for small and declining-enrolment schools before reaching the point where closure or consolidation is seen as the only option. Wynne said she was encouraged by the report's tone and the preference within its recommendations ensuring students are given the best possible learning environments and resources. \"The whole point -- to have the programs in place for kids in schools is a critical one and that's why the charts and information included are very valuable to both boards and parent groups,\" Wynne said. \"We can all get a bit more common understanding of the issue.\" Thames Valley District School Board chair James Stewart admitted in a weekend e-mail the devil on the implementation of the report's recommendations would be in the detail of any regulations Wynne issues. \"Anything that lightens the load of the taxpayer and effectively helps our students is welcome in these times,\" Stewart wrote. The report contains extensive recommendations on changes to the province's per-pupil Education Funding Formula, which has been in place since 1998. It recommends shifting more funding -- for example for computers and technology -- from per-pupil to school-based criteria, clarifying and changing temporary declining enrolment funding currently given to school boards. The report states schools in Ontario already have 68,000 fewer students in their desks than in September 1998, and projects schools will have 72,000 fewer students in by September 2012 than they do today. It was written by a working group of nine people led by Brant MPP Dave Levac and Renfrew County District School Board director of education Eleanor Newman. It also included participation from Thames Valley District School Board treasurer Brian Greene and Southwest Middlesex Mayor Doug Reycraft."]

She said she was also encouraged by the recommendation school boards be required to solicit interest from potential community partners for excess space in their schools. \"We're not just going to encourage this, but write regulations to say this is what should happen,\" Wynne said. \"It's a matter of figuring out how to do it and the language of the regulations.\" She was also encouraged by a related recommendation the province look to use empty space in schools to provide its services before building or leasing space elsewhere. She said it would require action beyond her own ministry, but reinforced the concept of community hubs where Ontarians can access as many services as possible. The report was released by Wynne Friday, and contains 21 recommendations for the START Ontario END government to help school boards and communities understand and deal with the impact of fewer school-aged children in the province. The group recommends the province and all school boards do a better job of explaining what declining enrolment is and how it affects a school's ability to teach students the skills they need to be successful. It wants the province to mandate a single template for reporting changes in enrolment, and that school boards be required to start considering options for small and declining-enrolment schools before reaching the point where closure or consolidation is seen as the only option. Wynne said she was encouraged by the report's tone and the preference within its recommendations ensuring students are given the best possible learning environments and resources. \"The whole point -- to have the programs in place for kids in schools is a critical one and that's why the charts and information included are very valuable to both boards and parent groups,\" Wynne said. \"We can all get a bit more common understanding of the issue.\" Thames Valley District School Board chair James Stewart admitted in a weekend e-mail the devil on the implementation of the report's recommendations would be in the detail of any regulations Wynne issues. \"Anything that lightens the load of the taxpayer and effectively helps our students is welcome in these times,\" Stewart wrote. The report contains extensive recommendations on changes to the province's per-pupil Education Funding Formula, which has been in place since 1998. It recommends shifting more funding -- for example for computers and technology -- from per-pupil to school-based criteria, clarifying and changing temporary declining enrolment funding currently given to school boards. The report states schools in Ontario already have 68,000 fewer students in their desks than in September 1998, and projects schools will have 72,000 fewer students in by September 2012 than they do today. It was written by a working group of nine people led by Brant MPP Dave Levac and Renfrew County District School Board director of education Eleanor Newman. It also included participation from Thames Valley District School Board treasurer Brian Greene and Southwest Middlesex Mayor Doug Reycraft."]

[" START Madison END will dump assessors . DANIELSVILLE - Madison County commissioners voted Monday to wipe clean the county Board of Tax Assessors by dismissing all four members. The county attorney will draft a letter of dismissal for the assessors laying out the reasons they're being dismissed and letting them know when they can appear before commissioners to tell their side of the story. Monday's vote, which was unanimous, comes after commissioners voted to take away the assessors' power over personnel and after Commission Chairman Anthony Dove requested that all the assessors resign. The tax assessors office and its governing board have been in turmoil for years and failed to finish the county's tax digest on time for nearly a decade. The chronically late digests - compilations of the value of all taxable county property - have caused confusion for taxpayers, who may have to pay two years' worth of taxes in 2009, Dove said at Monday's meeting. \"When you're hired to do a job, if you do not do your job in a week, you're let go - certainly, if you do not do that job in years,\" he said. Dove said he was forced to take action after the assessors recommended only one candidate in four months to fill the long-open job of chief appraiser and after the interim chief offered her resignation this month. Commissioners Stanley Thomas and John Pethel agreed that problems with the assessors had gone on long enough. \"Every section of the county, every taxpayer is concerned about this tax situation,\" Thomas said. Although the assessors board's chairman has promised to bring this year's digest in on time, \"we're further behind now than we have been in the last two or three years,\" Pethel said. \"I don't know how he intends to get the digest out without a chief appraiser.\" Commissioners voted to dismiss the assessors after a brief closed-door session Monday night. Commissioners also said they would vote next month on Dove's recommendation for a new chief appraiser. Before closing the meeting to the public, Commissioner Mike Youngblood pointed out that Board of Assessors Chairman David Ragland has been on the board for only seven months. Assessors Jim Escoe and Larry Stewart, who were appointed by commissioners in August 2005, attended Monday's meeting. Ragland and board Vice Chairwoman Samantha Garland, who was appointed in April 2004, were not there. Escoe said after the meeting he's approached commissioners at least a couple of times to explain the problems in the tax office, but he's been ignored. \"They don't want to know what the problem is,\" he said. \"They think the problem exists in everything.\" The assessors don't plan on backing down by resigning, and Escoe said he would take his case to a judge. \"I relish this; I want this,\" he said. \"Now we can go and get this out in the public.\""]

["DNR tickets out-of-state boaters avoiding START Ind. END tax. HAMMOND, Ind. (AP) \u0097 The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is cracking down on out-of-state boaters who do not pay Indiana excise taxes. More than 300 people with boats moored in Hammond and East Chicago have been fined for failing to pay the tax. As many as 89 people could face fines of $500 and have their driver's licenses suspended for not acting on the tickets. Out-of-state residents can register their boats in their home state, but must pay Indiana excise taxes if they boat in Indiana. The recent crackdown was prompted in part by complaints by angry Indiana residents who pay the state's excise tax when they register their boats. ``These people felt they were being cheated,'' said DNR Lt. Jerry Shepherd. At the large Hammond Marina, about 85 percent of boaters live outside of Indiana. Port Authority Director Milan Kruszynski said ticketed boaters weren't happy, especially since they have to travel to Lowell Town Court if they want to contest the ticket. Of the more than 300 boaters cited in Hammond and East Chicago, between 150 and 200 refused to comply, contested or did not respond to the notice, said DNR Public Information Officer Shawn Brown. The Indiana General Assembly passed a law in 2006 to allow greater enforcement of the state's excise tax. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources launched a public education campaign to convince out-of-state boaters that Indiana is serious about collecting the tax."]

[" START Laurel County END clerk honored at Lincoln Dinner.

But soon it was her grandfather\u2019s own turn to take to the stage. And when Laurel County Clerk Dean Johnson was inducted into the 5th District\u2019s Lincoln Club Hall of Fame, he beamed at his smiling granddaughter. Johnson was one of four inductees \u2014 and the only Laurel County resident \u2014 welcomed into the prestigious club Saturday. \u201cI feel good about it, naturally,\u201d he said of the honor. Johnson joins fellow inductees state Sen. Tom Jensen, R-London; former commonwealth\u2019s attorney Tom Handy and former senator Gene Huff. But Johnson said he wasn\u2019t sure what clinched the honor for him. \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to help and support the people who run for state and federal offices. I suppose it\u2019s because I\u2019ve tried to be a strong supporter.\u201d Johnson entered the political arena himself in the early 1970s when he ran for sheriff at the age of 31. \u201cI thought there was some room for some younger people,\u201d he said. Though he was defeated by 9 votes, Johnson was immediately hooked to the political game and, soon thereafter, made a bid to fill the county clerk seat. Again, he was narrowly defeated but not discouraged. In 1985, he won the clerk\u2019s seat and has occupied it ever since. Through it all, he has been a staunch Republican supporter, voting for Republican presidents and governors ever since he cast his first vote for Richard Nixon in 1960 at the age of 18. Johnson said he\u2019s admired many Republican presidents in his lifetime, including Dwight Eisenhower. \u201cHe was the greatest and the best we ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cI was about 10 and we studied about him. I think he did a lot to bring this nation into the modern era.\u201d Since, Johnson said he has been a fan of Ronald Reagan and \u201cbelieve it or not, I thought the Bushes did a fine job. \u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand the conditions they\u2019re serving under,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have to look at the times before we can be critical of anyone.\u201d Of Saturday\u2019s dinner, Johnson said he enjoyed speeches given by Senate President David Williams, U.S. Rep. Harold \u201cHal\u201d Rogers and U.S. Sens. Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning. \u201cI thought the content of them was good,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get into specifics about a contested race that they might have in the primary. I thought they limited their speech to what they were doing and what they want to see done.\u201d In terms of the future of the Republican party, Johnson is optimistic. \u201cI think they have to sit back and wait,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be situations they can take advantage of.

["Laurel County clerk honored at Lincoln Dinner. With her stunning red hair flaming, Rebecca Mays cozily sat on her papaw\u2019s lap Saturday night, listening to Kentucky\u2019s top politicos make rousing speeches at the Lincoln Day Dinner. But soon it was her grandfather\u2019s own turn to take to the stage. And when Laurel County Clerk Dean Johnson was inducted into the 5th District\u2019s Lincoln Club Hall of Fame, he beamed at his smiling granddaughter. Johnson was one of four inductees \u2014 and the only Laurel County resident \u2014 welcomed into the prestigious club Saturday. \u201cI feel good about it, naturally,\u201d he said of the honor. Johnson joins fellow inductees state Sen. Tom Jensen, R-London; former commonwealth\u2019s attorney Tom Handy and former senator Gene Huff. But Johnson said he wasn\u2019t sure what clinched the honor for him. \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to help and support the people who run for state and federal offices. I suppose it\u2019s because I\u2019ve tried to be a strong supporter.\u201d Johnson entered the political arena himself in the early 1970s when he ran for sheriff at the age of 31. \u201cI thought there was some room for some younger people,\u201d he said. Though he was defeated by 9 votes, Johnson was immediately hooked to the political game and, soon thereafter, made a bid to fill the county clerk seat. Again, he was narrowly defeated but not discouraged. In 1985, he won the clerk\u2019s seat and has occupied it ever since. Through it all, he has been a staunch Republican supporter, voting for Republican presidents and governors ever since he cast his first vote for Richard Nixon in 1960 at the age of 18. Johnson said he\u2019s admired many Republican presidents in his lifetime, including Dwight Eisenhower. \u201cHe was the greatest and the best we ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cI was about 10 and we studied about him. I think he did a lot to bring this nation into the modern era.\u201d Since, Johnson said he has been a fan of Ronald Reagan and \u201cbelieve it or not, I thought the Bushes did a fine job. \u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand the conditions they\u2019re serving under,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have to look at the times before we can be critical of anyone.\u201d Of Saturday\u2019s dinner, Johnson said he enjoyed speeches given by Senate President David Williams, U.S. Rep. Harold \u201cHal\u201d Rogers and START U.S. END Sens. Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning. \u201cI thought the content of them was good,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get into specifics about a contested race that they might have in the primary.

[" START Platte Co. END tops 32K for first time.

That\u2019s one more than in the previous year. All but one of the remaining counties lost population. Sherman County, which includes Loup City, held firm at 2,994. But an analysis from the University of Nebraska at Omaha\u2019s Center for Public Affairs Research shows changes overall were better than those seen in recent years. Small Hitchcock and Hayes counties in southwest Nebraska, for example, both gained population in the one-year period after several years of losses. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a one-year blip or something, but it\u2019s definitely interesting to see that,\u201d said UNO\u2019s David Drozd, a research associate. Dakota, Otoe and Washington counties, whose numbers typically go up, saw their populations fall. In December, the Census bureau reported the state gained 13,959 residents over the one-year period. That\u2019s the most Nebraska has seen in a dozen years. Drozd attributed the gain to people moving into Nebraska from states harder hit by the economic downturn, as well as a strong birth rate. Economic conditions also could have lured some people back to rural areas, including college students who returned to the farm, he said. \u201cBy and large, for rural areas, a lot of the commodity prices were relatively strong,\u201d he said. Several counties are seeing population levels unseen in decades. Lincoln County\u2019s population (North Platte) of 35,582 is closer than ever to its all-time high set in 1981. It needs about 220 more people to top it. Some counties that marked losses in 2008 saw their rates of decline slowing. Madison County, for example, lost just 20 people after losing hundreds after the closing of a Tyson Foods plant in 2006. The combined population of Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster counties continues to creep closer to the 1 million mark. They now account for 52 percent of the state\u2019s population, having more than 931,000 residents combined. In 2000, they controlled nearly 49 percent of the state\u2019s population. With the 2010 Census quickly approaching, the latest estimates confirm a timely change of course within Nebraska\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. The district that includes more than three-fourths of the state lost about 2,700 people annually in the first six years of the decade. But in 2008, it gained about 150 people. Drozd estimates its total population now sits at 551,000. Every 10 years following the census, seats in the U.S. House of Representatives must be redistributed fairly among the states. In 2000, Nebraska\u2019s slow growth sparked concern that the state could lose a seat a decade down the line. More than 70 years ago, Nebraska had six congressional districts.

The combined population of Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster counties continues to creep closer to the 1 million mark. They now account for 52 percent of the state\u2019s population, having more than 931,000 residents combined. In 2000, they controlled nearly 49 percent of the state\u2019s population. With the 2010 Census quickly approaching, the latest estimates confirm a timely change of course within Nebraska\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. The district that includes more than three-fourths of the state lost about 2,700 people annually in the first six years of the decade. But in 2008, it gained about 150 people.

["More rural residents self-employed. START OMAHA END -- A University of Nebraska sociologist says the state\u2019s waning rural population is changing the way people do business. Randy Cantrell, with the university\u2019s Rural Initiative, said in most rural counties, between 18 percent and 30 percent or more of jobs are now due to self-employment. And, that accounts for virtually all job growth in rural areas. He believes the popularity of self-employment is on the rise in rural Nebraska. Cantrell hasn\u2019t been able to put his finger on such details through his research, namely an annual rural poll that surveys rural residents on well-being, policy and work issues. But he has a theory: The rural poll is asking the wrong question. In the past, people have been asked if they have a business. Cantrell realizes that may be leaving out those who still get a paycheck from their employers, but technically are private contractors. He used the example of inbound telemarketers, who he thinks can rightfully assert they have a business. As rural areas continue to see their population numbers fall, Cantrell said he expects that to put pressure on employers to shift away from the traditional way of doing business and rely on private contractors. \u201cThere\u2019s still a demand for service but not enough to support a business of several employees,\u201d he said. Cantrell details the phenomenon and other observations about Nebraska\u2019s economic and demographic changes in a new report based on 2007 census data and other federal statistics. Census data released this week shows the state\u2019s three largest counties \u201d Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy \u201d grew by 14,240 people collectively in 2008. The remaining 90 counties declined by 281. Cantrell said he plans to revise his report with the newly released information. The rural poll will take another shot at the \u201cbusiness\u201d question this year, which is on its way to 7,000 Nebraska households. The survey is conducted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln\u2019s Center for Applied Rural Innovation in cooperation with the Rural Initiative and UNL\u2019s Department of Agricultural Economics. Cantrell\u2019s study also notes the continued decline of those under age 20 living in rural areas. All but seven counties in the state declined in this population group during this decade, he said in the report. Cherry County, for example, saw a 20 percent drop in people under age 20 between 2000 and 2007. He attributes the changes to people leaving the state \u201d likely for economic reasons \u201d and a decline in birth rates."]

["New School to Open in Old Town. This fall, the classical education is coming back to START Alexandria END, but almost half a year and several large hurdles remain before the school can officially open its doors. The move to establish the Washington Latin School, led by T.R. Ahlstrom and Headmaster Tom Soule, is gearing up for the start to its academic calendar on September 8 at a location yet to be determined in Old Town. The school hopes to attract students with a rigorous, classics-based curriculum and a significantly reduced tuition, due to the current economy. Students enrolling for the school\u2019s first year will pay an annual tuition of $14,000, plus other fees, during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years, roughly $10,000 less than the original sticker price. Once the school\u2019s financial base is strong enough, Ahlstrom and Soule plan to admit students on a partial- or full-scholarship basis \u2014 the founders are aware that the $24,000 average price tag is not possible for everyone \u2014 making it financially viable for students from lower-income backgrounds to attend. \u201cMy take on this, and T.R. and I have talked about this before, is \u2018classics for everyone,\u2019\u201d Soule said. \u201cFar too often that kind of education isn\u2019t available to people of all socio-economic backgrounds.\u201d Ahlstrom said that the results found at the Washington Latin Public Charter School in Washington, D.C., one of two public Latin schools that he has helped found in the last seven years \u2014 Bronx Latin in New York City is the other \u2014 prove that people of all economic backgrounds can thrive in the demanding, classical setting. Currently, there are three locations in Old Town being looked at as the school\u2019s initial home, Soule and Ahlstrom said. The educational philosophy at the Washington Latin School in Alexandria is somewhat similar to Ahlstrom\u2019s previous two endeavors, but is setting out as an independent, privately funded school rather than one receiving public funds. \u201cThis is my third school in the last seven years,\u201d Ahlstrom said. \u201cThe other projects were very successful, and we believe this one will be more successful because we\u2019ve chosen not to do it as a public school, but as an independent, co-educational classical school. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a basher of public schools, I\u2019m a product of them. The fact of the matter is that there is one kind of school in this country for prosperous people and another kind of education for everyone else.\u201d Both Ahlstrom and Soule worked at the Washington Latin School Charter School before leaving in late 2007 to start the independent school venture. Soule said that by then, they \u201chad reached a ceiling\u201d with what they were able to do educationally at the charter school and wanted to move on to a new situation that would allow for more independence. According to Soule and Charter School Board meeting minutes, the D.C. Charter School Board disagreed with Ahlstrom\u2019s proposal to move the school from Northwest D.C. to Penn Quarter and ultimately nixed the idea. The charter school\u2019s current headmaster, Martha Cutts, came on after Ahlstrom and Soule left, but said that in the time since the school has continued to flourish, swelling to 341 students this year from 179 only two years before. In 2008, the school opened a second campus in D.C. for its eighth and ninth graders, and applications for the upcoming school year are up 74 percent, Cutts said. While it appears the charter school is established and growing, the Washington Latin School in Alexandria has its own set of hurdles to clear. Getting students and their families to move away from their current schools could be considered one of the project\u2019s biggest obstacles, but Ahlstrom and Soule are confident that the niche they\u2019re trying to fill with the Washington Latin School is one that will not struggle to attract students. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem getting kids and families to commit,\u201d Ahlstrom said. \u201cEvery school we\u2019ve ever done, there\u2019s a long line at the door.

[" START Chicopee END residents discuss conservation land purchase. Several residents in the area had protested land owner Yves Demers' plans to build single-family homes on the land. He is now negotiating to sell 30.23 acres to the city for conservation purposes while keeping 1.5 acres at the end of Nelson Street to build two single-family homes. The land has been appraised at $450,000, while he has signed an \"offer to sell real estate\" agreement with the city for $500,000. In December, the council granted Demers a zone change from industrial to Residential A on 31.7 acres there to build single family houses. Bissonnette told residents the city doesn't want to build a park on the conservation land. Some residents are concerned about increased traffic in the neighborhood if the land becomes a recreational area. \"This is not going to be a park. The idea is to keep it in its most natural setting,\" Bissonnette said. The City Council's Recreation Committee will hold a public hearing on the grant application on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in Council Chambers in City Hall. The mayor and city department heads also gave briefings on the Front Street reconstruction project, that has just begun, along with the upcoming Center Street reconstruction project, the CVS under construction at Hampden and Center streets, and construction of the bike path-canal park from Front Street near City Hall to Grape Street that should begin next month."]

Employees at First Bank told police that a man approached the counter at 4:45 p.m. wearing a baseball cap, a gray hooded jacket, blue jeans and white shoes and lifted his jacket to show the butt of a handgun tucked into his waistband, according to a search warrant. The warrant was filed Tuesday in START Madison County END for Chesnut's home in the 2400 block of Gillis Street in Alton. The man passed an index card to the teller which read \"This a robbery. I have a gun. Do not call Police. Give me your hundreds, fifties and twenties. \"An off-duty police officer stopped Chesnut's Ford Mustang, bearing Illinois license plates, a short while later. The officer traced the plates to the Gillis Street address. He found $4,470 in a bag inside the engine compartment, according to an affidavit filed with the search warrant. Chesnut matched the description of a suspect in the Dec. 5 bank robbery in which a man wearing a dark hooded jacket entered the bank and showed the teller the butt of his gun and demanded cash. Three tellers were working at the time, and the man approached her window speaking on a cell phone, according to a Vanderburgh County Sheriff's report. A teller gave him $5,800, according to the affidavit. The teller later picked Chesnut out of a police lineup, according to the report. On March 7, FBI agents searched Chesnut's home. They seized bank statements, collection notices, credit reports and bank notices that indicated that his Godfrey funeral business was struggling, according to the return."]

["Arts center features works by master carver. START WOODBURY END \u2014 The Arts Center of Cannon County announces the opening of \u201cAn Old Man Has Visions\u201d featuring the wood carvings of James Bunch. This exhibit will be featured in the Marly Berger Gallery through May 9. Working from memory, with only a pocketknife and the occasional handsaw, James Bunch has produced a body of work estimated at 300 pieces which range in subject matter from the familiar tools and mechanics which have been central to his life to elaborate pieces notable for their detail and kinetic features. \u201cHis human figures are perhaps most striking, consistently stylized as stiff but expressive individuals sharing hallmarks of character and community,\u201d said Robert Cogswell, director of folklife for the Tennessee Arts Commission. Careful inspection of his work reveals not only fine carving but a commitment to carefully executing every part of his creations. Using the skills of a traditional wood carver, Bunch invents shockingly realistic creations that have to be seen to be believed. Admission to \u201cAn Old Man Has Visions\u201d is free.

["Cipolli, START New London END on the record. Ever since New London Police Chief Tom Cipolli made a public appeal to keep his job, New Londoners have been asking why Mayor Mike McBeth has been seeking to remove him. The mayor had planned to lay out his case at a public hearing on Tuesday, more than three months after the issue became public; but a 3-2 vote by the city council delayed that hearing until April, visibly frustrating McBeth and many of the 60 residents who turned out in search of answers. Neither McBeth nor Cipolli has publicly addressed the specific complaints behind McBeth\u2019s request to dismiss the chief. But the Mt. Pleasant News has reviewed legal documents filed as evidence in the matter, and Cipolli\u2019s formal response, which provide the clearest and most comprehensive look so far at the dispute between the two men. The files that accompany McBeth\u2019s request cite 21 different reasons that McBeth was to cite in support of the action \u2013 alleging improper conduct, poor management of the police force, insubordination, untruthful statements to police and city officials and general incompetence. Cipolli, who has called McBeth's accusations \"false and misleading,\" offers a broad response, including a look back at his nearly two years leading the New London Police Department, while responding to several of the claims made in McBeth's case. \"I strongly believe that I have changed the department for the better,\" Cipolli writes, asserting that crime in New London has fallen during his tenure, to which he credited better training and improved professionalism within the department and stronger relationships with the community. \"These positive relationships continue today,\" he writes, \"as do my efforts to insure New London is a safe community. \"The 119-page request includes seven affidavits, two from New London police officers, four from area residents and one from Winfield police chief John Chaney. At the end is a seven-page response from Cipolli. The full text of Cipolli's reponse, as well as each of the affidavits, can be read by following the links in this article. In addition, the files include e-mails from Cipolli, a section of the New London Code of Ordinances, Police Bill of Rights and police department manual, police expense reports and newspaper articles written on the matter.

He said the revenues have been trending downward over the last two months. Hopkins said the city has about $400,000 in reserves if needed. The council also discussed:\u00e2 \u00a2 canceling the May 9 City of Athens general elections. City Administrator Pam Burton said only Mayor Randy Daniel and Councilmember Place 1 Jerry Don Vaught filed for the two available seats. Since the law allowing entities without a contested race to cancel elections went into effect in 1996, Athens has had few contested municipal races. Elections were canceled in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007 and 2008. \u00e2 \u00a2 authorizing a contract with Brinkley Sargent Architects for a facility needs study. The council voted on Jan. 13 to put the matter on hold for 60 days. Burton said at the time the council should wait to see what the economic conditions would be before committing to spending the $39,500. \u201cAs you can tell there has not been any positive change,\u201d Burton said.

[" START Oxford END clothes swapping parties look Swish! . WOMEN raced to get their hands on each other\u2019s clothes during a charity fundraiser in Oxford. The \u2018swishing\u2019 event, at Baby Simple bar in Cowley Road on Saturday, was held in aid of pioneering East Oxford children\u2019s hospice Helen & Douglas House.

["Investors flock to buy START California END bonds. SACRAMENTO \u2014 Investors this week flocked to California's first major bond sale in nine months, a development that will soon free up billions of dollars for public works projects put on hold because of the state's budget mess. State Treasurer Bill Lockyer announced that the state sold $6.54 billion in general obligation bonds on Monday and Tuesday, easily surpassing a $4 billion target he had set going into the sale. His office said late Tuesday it was the largest long-term general obligation bond sale \"ever in the country.\" The tax-exempt bonds carry yields ranging from 3.2 to 6.1 percent, depending on when they mature (from 2013 to 2038). \"This is a great result for California's workers, businesses and economy,\" Lockyer said in a statement. California has been shut out of the debt market because of its budget mess and the tight national credit market. And without the ability to sell bonds, the state was forced to freeze about $2.6 billion in financing since December for more than 5,000 infrastructure projects. With the deficit addressed for the time being with the plan signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last month, officials said recently that they expect soon to unfreeze $500 million in infrastructure funds that had been put on hold. But after this week's sale, they are expected to unlock an additional $2.6 billion for public works projects, although it could take several weeks to disburse the money. Roxanne Miller, a lobbyist for the city of San Jose, said that can't happen soon enough. Dozens of projects in San Jose are awaiting financing from the state's so-called Pooled Money Investment Account, including a $15 million traffic light synchronization project; $5.5 million for improvements to public trails; and several million dollars for affordable housing projects. With the state's finances in shambles, San Jose has had to front the money to keep many of those projects going, Miller said. But that can continue only for so long. \"We're getting to the point where everyone needs some indication, some certainty that the money will be there,\" she said. Miller added that a $10 million project to upgrade Highway 101 at Tully Road, scheduled to begin construction within months, will be put on hold if state infrastructure funds aren't unleashed soon. She called the successful bond sale \"a big deal for all of us.\" The state's move to freeze infrastructure funds was at odds not only with Schwarzenegger's stated priorities but with the federal stimulus package approved last month. Last week, the governor held a news conference to tout 57 projects in line to receive the first injection of federal stimulus dollars for transportation, totaling $626 million. Santa Clara County projects on that list include $33 million for a rehab of Highway 280 from the Cypress Avenue pedestrian over-crossing to Tantau Avenue, and maintenance of a stretch of Highway 35 near Los Gatos."]

["Investors flock to buy California bonds. SACRAMENTO \u2014 Investors this week flocked to California's first major bond sale in nine months, a development that will soon free up billions of dollars for public works projects put on hold because of the state's budget mess. State Treasurer Bill Lockyer announced that the state sold $6.54 billion in general obligation bonds on Monday and Tuesday, easily surpassing a $4 billion target he had set going into the sale. His office said late Tuesday it was the largest long-term general obligation bond sale \"ever in the country.\" The tax-exempt bonds carry yields ranging from 3.2 to 6.1 percent, depending on when they mature (from 2013 to 2038). \"This is a great result for California's workers, businesses and economy,\" Lockyer said in a statement. California has been shut out of the debt market because of its budget mess and the tight national credit market. And without the ability to sell bonds, the state was forced to freeze about $2.6 billion in financing since December for more than 5,000 infrastructure projects. With the deficit addressed for the time being with the plan signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last month, officials said recently that they expect soon to unfreeze $500 million in infrastructure funds that had been put on hold. But after this week's sale, they are expected to unlock an additional $2.6 billion for public works projects, although it could take several weeks to disburse the money. Roxanne Miller, a lobbyist for the city of San Jose, said that can't happen soon enough. Dozens of projects in START San Jose END are awaiting financing from the state's so-called Pooled Money Investment Account, including a $15 million traffic light synchronization project; $5.5 million for improvements to public trails; and several million dollars for affordable housing projects. With the state's finances in shambles, San Jose has had to front the money to keep many of those projects going, Miller said. But that can continue only for so long. \"We're getting to the point where everyone needs some indication, some certainty that the money will be there,\" she said. Miller added that a $10 million project to upgrade Highway 101 at Tully Road, scheduled to begin construction within months, will be put on hold if state infrastructure funds aren't unleashed soon.

["Students go into START Oxford END 's Dragon's Den. SCHOOLCHILDREN in Oxford have been putting forward business ideas before a panel of \u201cBusiness Angels\u201d in the city\u2019s own version of hit television programme Dragon\u2019s Den. Pupils from three city schools gave pitches to a panel of Angels under the new Business X scheme \u2014 all for a share of \u00a330,000. Pupils at Matthew Arnold School, in Botley, St Gregory the Great School in East Oxford and Magdalen College School, Cowley Place, have been working on their proposals for months with the help of MBA students from the Said Business School. After several hours, the panel of venture capitalists, businessmen and women and entrepreneurs, agreed to invest in two of the schemes, pending further information. St Gregory the Great School\u2019s team, which was seeking funds to develop a community allotment, got the backing of the panel. They asked for \u00a34,800 and have been told they will get financial backing, though the final figure has not yet been agreed. Team member Vaughan Matthews, 17, from Cowley, said: \u201cIt was a great experience. It was very difficult. Most of us have seen Dragon\u2019s Den and you can criticise the show, but until you\u2019re in that position, you can\u2019t describe what it\u2019s like.\u201d Philip Blackwell, from the Blackwell family behind the famous Broad Street bookshop, told the group: \u201cWe loved it and we thought you were enthusiastic, ambitious, and your scheme had great environmental and social benefits.\u201d The Angels decided against investing in Matthew Arnold School\u2019s specialist puzzle cube, but were so impressed by the way the group worked together, they offered to work with them to find a different product. They had asked for \u00a315,000 for a laser cutter to create the cube, aimed at the disabled market. Adam Newport, 14, from Botley, said: \u201cWe have all put a lot of work in this, all of us have pulled our weight and it has been interesting.\u201d Two different groups from Magdalen College School took part in the contest, with business ideas for a yearbook company and for an environmental social networking site. The panel decided to invest in the first scheme, but not in the second. Ely Sandler, from the yearbook project called Form, said: \u201cWe have put a lot of effort into this and Business X has been very helpful. \u201cIt is a really good idea and it\u2019s a great way to get us started.\u201d The different groups will report back to the Business Angels on July 1.

["City manager seeks support for road work. START Huntsville END City Manager Bill Baine is currently working to gather support \u2014 both at the city level and at the county level \u2014 for an improvement project on state Highway 19. At a recent Walker County Commissioners Court meeting, the five-member court agreed to assist Baine in receiving a $2 million engineering grant with a $400,000 matching requirement. Now, Baine must take the grant before City Council, and he said he is very hopeful that the council will also be supportive of the project. \u201cThe grant we\u2019re looking at is a $2 million federal grant for economic development and hurricane mitigation,\u201d Baine said. \u201cOur justification for applying for the grant is that we want to improve Highway 19 so it can take some traffic off of Interstate 45 and around the city, especially during hurricane evacuations. \u201cReceiving this $2 million, which would be used to design of an improved 6.2-mile portion of Highway 19, would get us in line for future funding for the construction costs.\u201d According to Glenn Isbell, city engineer for the City of Huntsville, the portion of Highway 19 that would be addressed in the plan rests with Huntsville city limits and includes several major intersections. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re looking at creating an urban arterial on a portion of Highway 19 between Interstate 45 and Highway 30 that is largely undeveloped,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would involve creating a five-lane, curb and gutter section with a raised center median which would allow for left-turn movements. \u201cWe would also want to construct on- and off-ramps at the intersections of Highway 19 and state Highway 75, Bearkat Boulevard and Highway 190. With the right ramp configuration, the ramp at Bearkat Boulevard would become a major entrance into Sam Houston State University. \u201cAs well, we would also look at some possible traffic signals to control cross-over traffic, and we would also consider reducing the speed limit from 60 miles per hour to 50 in that portion of Highway 19.\u201d Including the $2 million engineering grant, Isbell said the total cost of the improvement project would be approximately $21 million. \u201cIn effect, this $2 million grant would be a down payment on the rest of the project,\u201d Baine said. \u201cThe construction project would be about $19 million total, and what we\u2019re trying to do is keep the taxpayers from paying too much, both now or during the possible construction phase. \u201cThe Commissioners Court has already agreed to pay one-third of our $400,000 matching requirement for the $2 million grant, and I anticipate that the City Council will respond favorably to assisting with that matching requirement, as well.\u201d Local considerationsThe lack of safety for current Highway 19 users is another large factor contributing to the project, Baine said. \u201cOne person a year is killed, each and ever year, on that highway,\u201d Baine said. \u201cPlus, we have about 54 crashes on that road each year which result in about 47 injuries involving some level of hospitalization. \u201cThe people getting hurt are not the old or the very young, but the middle-young, and the accidents are taking place at the times of the day when people go to school.\u201d While environmental studies, cost studies and even land acquisitions have taken place since 1968, no strong action has taken place with regard to Highway 19 until the recent county decision to provide support. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make this issue something the citizens can unite over so pressure an be put on political leaders above the city,\u201d Baine said. \u201cThe decision by the Commissioners Court to provide financial support was in many ways unprecedented, but now we have to think about working with Rep. Kevin Brady, state Rep.

Muscogee County school board members James Walker and Pat Hugley-Green will keep their seats, while local business owner and parent Norene Marvets will be District 7's new representative. In the District 1 race, incumbent Pat Hugley-Green collected 4,782 votes, Mary Walker got 2,204 votes, and Christopher Seldon received 568 votes. In the District 3 race, James Walker gathered 4,225 votes to challenger Duane Melvin's 1,902. In the District 7 race, Marvets received 2,478 votes, and opponent Ryan Newbern collected 1,756 votes. This is the second time Walker has beaten out Melvin for the school board's District 3 seat. The two ran against each other in 2004. Tuesday night, Walker collected about 69 percent of the vote. \"I feel great,\" he said after the race was called by the Ledger-Enquirer at about 9 p.m. He said he was out to win, but that the race was not about him \u0097 it was about the children. \"I love what I do,\" Walker said. \"I do it for the children.\" Both candidates campaigned on improving student achievement and preparing for the students expected after the U.S. Army relocates the Armor School from Fort Knox, Ky., to Fort Benning. Growth due to the Base Realignment and Closure is expected to bring about 6,500 students to the Muscogee County School District. \"We will continue to help the schools get better,\" Walker said. \"We only have a few schools that are not making AYP.\" Walker, a retired insurance agent, has served on the board for 14 years and is currently its chairman. Melvin is a retired Army major who works as a unit manager in the Stewart County Detention Facility in Lumpkin, Ga. Hugley-Green collected about 63 percent of the vote. Challengers Mary Walker and Seldon received 29 percent and 8 percent of the vote, respectively. Hugley-Green has been on the board for one four-year term. During her tenure on the board, she has helped get pay raises for all employees, campaigned to rename Eastway Elementary as Lonnie Jackson Academy and fought to build a new Rigdon Road Elementary School. Walker is a real estate broker and former educator who ran against Hugley-Green in 2004 and lost. She taught at Reese Road and Claflin elementary schools. Seldon is an electrical contractor who has volunteered as a coach, mentor and tutor at the YMCA and Clubview Elementary. In the District 7 race, Marvets gathered about 58 percent of the vote.

["Residents escape fire at Northland apartments . A neighbor was banging on the door of their START North Kansas City END apartment, alerting them that the adjacent building was on fire.

The wind-fanned fire quickly spread to the second apartment building, where Rose lived. Fire crews from North Kansas City and Kansas City used aerial hoses to pour water on the blaze. The thick, black smoke was visible for miles along Interstate 35. Fire officials did not know how many residents were displaced. Investigators are expected to spend today picking through debris to determine how the fire started. The high winds made for difficult work for the fire crews, said North Kansas City Fire Marshal David Dollins. Two firefighters reported minor injuries, but fire officials knew of no injuries among residents."]
